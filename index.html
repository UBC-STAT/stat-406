<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>assess the prediction properties of the supervised learning methods covered in class;</li>
  <li>correctly use regularization to improve predictions from linear models, and also to identify important explanatory variables;</li>
  <li>explain the practical
difference between predictions obtained with parametric and non-parametric methods, and decide in specific applications which approach should be used;</li>
  <li>select and construct appropriate ensembles to obtain improved predictions in different contexts;</li>
  <li>select sensible clustering methods and correctly interpret their output;</li>
  <li>correctly utilize and interpret principal components and other dimension reduction techniques;</li>
  <li>employ reasonable coding practices and understand basic R syntax and function.</li>
</ol>
