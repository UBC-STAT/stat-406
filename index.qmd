* Assess the prediction properties of the supervised learning methods covered in class; 
* Correctly use regularization to improve predictions from linear models, and also to identify important explanatory variables; 
* Explain the practical
difference between predictions obtained with parametric and non-parametric methods, and decide in specific applications which approach should be used; 
* Select and construct appropriate ensembles to obtain improved predictions in different contexts; 
* correctly utilize and interpret principal components and other dimension reduction techniques;
* employ reasonable coding practices and understand basic R syntax and function.
