## Last time

1. What is a model (formal definition)?
1. Evaluating models (risk/loss functions)
1. Decomposing risk (bias, variance, irreducible error)

## What is a model?

A model is a set of distributions that explain data $\{ Z = (X, Y) \}$, i.e.

$$\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \mid X \sim \mathcal N( f(X), \sigma^2) \quad \text{for some ``smooth'' }f \}$$


[(Why do we have to specify that $f$ is smooth? Why can't it be any function?)]{.secondary} \


### Goal of learning

Choose the $P \in \mathcal P$ that makes the "best" predictions on new $X, Y$ pairs.

[(Next slide: how do we formalize "best"?)]{.secondary}


## How do we evaluate models?

$$\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \mid X \sim \mathcal N( f(X), \sigma^2) \quad \text{for some ``smooth'' f} \}$$

1. Specify how a $P \in \mathcal P$ makes **predictions**  $\hat Y$ on new inputs $X$. \
[(E.g.: $\hat Y = f(X)$ for $P = \mathcal N(f(X), \sigma^2)$.)]{.secondary}

2. Introduce a **loss** function $\ell(Y, \hat{Y})$ (a datapoint-level function). \
[(E.g.: $\ell(Y, \hat Y) = (Y - \hat Y)^2$)]{.secondary}

3. Define the **test error** of $P \in \mathcal P$ as the expected loss (a population-level function): \
[$T_n(P) = E[\ell(Y, \hat Y)] = E[(Y - f(X))^2]$]{.secondary}

4. The **best** model is the one that minimizes the test error \
[($P^* = \argmin_{P \in \mathcal P} T_n(P)$)]{.secondary}


---

Last time: when $\ell(Y, \hat Y) = (Y - \hat Y)^2$, we showed that the **regression function** is the best model:

. . .

$$
\text{Regression function } \triangleq E[Y \mid X] = \argmin_{P \in \mathcal P} T_n(P) = \argmin_{P \in \mathcal P} E[\ell(Y, \hat Y)]
$$

[Are we done? Have we solved learning?]{.secondary}

. . .

No! We don't know what $E[Y \mid X]$ is! We have to *estimate it from data!*

$$
\hat f(X) \approx E[Y \mid X]
$$

(We'll discuss various methods for producing $\hat f(X)$ estimators throughout this course.)


## Risk (Expected Test Error) and its Decomposition

Our estimator $\hat f$ is a random variable (it depends on training sample).\
So let's consider the _risk_ (the _expected test error_):

$$
R_n = E_{\hat f} \left[ T_n(\hat f) \right] = E_{\hat f, X, Y} \left[ \ell(Y, \hat f(X)) \right]
$$

. . .

::: callout-note
Test error is a metric for a fixed $\hat f$.
It averages over all possible test points, but assumes a fixed training set.

Risk averages over **everything** that is random:
(1) the test data point sampled from our population, and
(2) the training data that produces $\hat f$
:::


## Risk (Expected Test Error) and its Decomposition

When $\ell(Y, \hat Y) = (Y - \hat Y)^2$, the prediction risk of $\hat f(X)$ decomposes into two factors:

$$
R_n \quad = \quad \underbrace{E_{\hat f, X, Y} \left[ \: \left( E[Y\mid X] - \hat f(X) \right)^2 \right]}_{(1)} \quad + \quad \underbrace{E_{X, Y} \left[ \: \left( Y - E[Y\mid X] \right)^2 \right]}_{(2)}
$$

. . .

1. **Estimation error** (or "reducible error")
2. **Irreducible error** (or "noise")

---

The **estimation error term** further reduces into two components:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underbrace{E_{\hat f, X, Y} \left[ \: \left( E[Y\mid X] -\hat f(X) \right)^2 \right]}_{\text{Estimation error}} \quad &= \quad \underbrace{ E_{X, Y} \left[ \left( E[Y\mid X] - E \left[\hat f(X) \mid X\right] \right)^2 \right]}_{(A)} \quad \\
&+ \quad \underbrace{E_{\hat f, X} \left[ \: \left( E \left[\hat f(X) \mid X\right] -\hat f(X) \right)^2 \right]}_{(B)}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

A.  **Bias**^2
B.  **Variance**

Analogous decompositions hold for other loss/risk functions.

## Sources of bias and variance

### What conditions give rise to a high bias estimator?

::: fragment
- Not enough covariates (small $p$)
- Model is too simple
- Model is _misspecified_ (doesn't accurately represent the data generating process)
- Bad training algorithm
:::

### What conditions give rise to a high variance estimator?

::: fragment
- Not enough training samples (small $n$)
- Model is too complicated
- Lots of irreducible noise in training data (if my model has power to fit noise, it will)

:::

# How do we estimate $R_n$?

\
$R_n$ is a theoretical construct. \
We can never know the true $R_n$ for a given $\hat f$.
We also have to estimate it from data.



## Don't use training error


The training error in regression is

$$\widehat{R}_n(\widehat{f}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2$$

Here, the $n$ is doubly used (annoying, but simple): $n$ observations to create $\widehat{f}$ and $n$ terms in the sum.

::: callout-tip
We also call $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ the **empirical risk**.
:::

. . .

$\hat R_n(\hat f)$ is a bad estimator for $R_n$. \
So we should [__never__]{.secondary} use it.


## Why is $\hat R_n$ a bad estimator of $R_n$?

. . .

1. It doesn't say anything about predictions on new data. \
   [(It's a measure of how well the model fits a **fixed set** of training data.)]{.secondary}

2. It can be made **arbitrarily small** by making your model more complex.


## [1. It doesn't say anything about predictions on new data.]{.small}

These all have the same $R^2$ and Training Error

  kableExtra::kable(digits = 2)
```

:::
:::

## 2. It can be made **arbitrarily small** by making your model more complex.

Adding "junk" predictors increases $R^2$ and decreases Training Error

```{r}
n <- 100
p <- 10
q <- 0:30
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * (p + max(q))), nrow = n)
y <- x[, 1:p] %*% c(5:1, 1:5) + rnorm(n, 0, 10)

regress_on_junk <- function(q) {
  x <- x[, 1:(p + q)]
  mod <- lm(y ~ x)
  tibble(R2 = summary(mod)$r.sq,  train_error = mean((y - predict(mod))^2))
}
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
map(q, regress_on_junk) |> 
  list_rbind() |>
  mutate(q = q) |>
  pivot_longer(-q) |>
  ggplot(aes(q, value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) + xlab("train_error") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(blue, orange), guide = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_y")
```


## Other things you can't use

You should not use `anova` 

or the $p$-values from the `lm` output for this purpose.

. . .

> These things are to determine whether those _parameters_ are different from zero if you were to repeat the experiment many times, if the model were true, etc. etc.

In other words, they are useful for _inference problems_.

This is not the same as being useful for _prediction problems_ (i.e. how to get small $R_n$).


## Don't use training error: the formal argument

Our training error $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ is an **estimator** of $R_n$.

So we can ask "is $\widehat{R}_n(\hat{f})$ a good estimator for $R_n$?"

## The error of our risk estimator

Let's measure the **error** of our empirical risk estimator:

$$E[(R_n - \hat R_n(\hat f))^2]$$
[(What is the expectation with respect to?)]{.secondary}


## The error of our risk estimator

$$E[(R_n - \hat R_n(\hat f))^2]$$

- $R_n$ is deterministic (we average over test data and training data)
- $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ also only depends on training data
- So the expectation is with respect to our training dataset

. . .

As before, we can decompose the error of our risk estimator into **bias** and **variance**

$$
E[(R_n - \hat R_n(\hat f))^2] = \underbrace{( R_n - E[\hat R_n(\hat f)])^2}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{E[( \hat R_n(\hat f) - E[\hat R_n(\hat f)])^2]}_{\text{variance}}
$$

### Is the bias of $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ small or large? Why?

## Is the bias of $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ small or large? Why?

- Assume we have a very complex model capable of (nearly) fitting our training data
  - I.e. $\hat R_n(\hat f) \approx 0$
- $\text{Bias} = ( R_n - E[\hat R_n(\hat f)])^2 \approx ( R_n - 0 ) = R_n$
- (That's the worst bias we could get! 😔)


## Formalizing why $\hat R_n(\hat f)$ is a bad estimator of $R_n$

Consider an alternative estimator built from $\{ (X_j, Y_j) \}_{j=1}^m$ that was not part of the training set.
$$\tilde R_m(\hat f) = {\textstyle \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m} \ell(Y_j, \hat f(X_j)),
$$
The error of this estimator can also be decompsed into **bias** and **variance**
$$
E[(R_n - \tilde R_m(\hat f))^2] = \underbrace{( R_n - E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j}[\tilde R_m(\hat f)])^2}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j}[( \tilde R_m(\hat f) - E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j}[\tilde R_m(\hat f)])^2]}_{\text{variance}}
$$

### Is the bias of $\tilde R_m(\hat f)$ small or large? Why?

## Is the bias of $\tilde R_m(\hat f)$ small or large? Why?

$\tilde R_m(\hat f)$ has _zero_ bias!

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j} \left[ \tilde R_m(\hat f) \right]
&= E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j} \left[ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \ell(Y_j, \hat f(X_j)) \right] \\
&= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m E_{\hat f,X_j,Y_j} \left[ \ell(Y_j, \hat f(X_j)) \right]
= R_n
\end{aligned}
$$


# How to properly estimate $R_n$


## Holdout sets

One option is to have a separate "holdout" or "validation" dataset.

::: callout-tip
This option follows the logic on the previous slide. \
If we randomly "hold out" $\{ (X_j, Y_j) \}_{j=1}^m$ from the training set,
we can use this data to get an (nearly) unbiased estimator of $R_n$.
$$
R_n \approx \tilde R_m(\hat f) \triangleq {\textstyle{\frac 1 m \sum_{j=1}^m \ell ( Y_j - \hat Y_j(X_j))}}
$$

👍 Estimates the test error

👍 Fast computationally

🤮 Estimate is random 

🤮 Estimate has high variance (depends on 1 choice of split)

🤮 Estimate has a little bias (because we aren't estimating $\hat f$ from all of the training data)


## Aside {background-color="#97D4E9"}

In my experience, CS has particular definitions of "training", "validation", and "test" data.

I think these are not quite the same as in Statistics.

* [Test data]{.secondary} - Hypothetical data you don't get to see, ever. Infinite amounts drawn from the population.
    * _Expected test error_ or _Risk_ is an expected value over this distribution. It's _not_ a sum over some data kept aside.
* Sometimes I'll give you "test data". You pretend that this is a good representation of the expectation and use it to see how well you did on the training data.
* [Training data]{.secondary} - This is "holdout" data that you get to touch.
* [Validation set]{.secondary} - Often, we need to _choose models_. One way to do this is to split off some of your training data and pretend that it's like a "Test Set".

When and how you split your training data can be very important.

# Review of Risk (Estimation)

We fixed a bunch of subtle issues in the Sept 19 Risk Estimation slides.

And I've noticed some related confusion in my office hours, so it's *review time*!

. . . 

::: callout-tip
After this lecture, make sure to review the whole Risk Estimation slide deck to see all the fixed terminology/definitions/examples.
:::

## Risk vs. Test Error

- **Risk** ($R_n$): expected error when the training data *have not yet been observed* **(random!)**
    - depends on true data distribution, predictor

- **Test Error** ($T_n$): expected error when the training data *have been observed* **(fixed!)**
    - depends on true data distribution, predictor, training data 

- $R_n = \E[T_n]$

. . .

- we mostly care about **risk** when *designing* a new predictor / estimator
    - we want to know how well it will work on *future training and test data*
- we mostly care about **test error** when we've *fit* a predictor / estimator
    - we want to know how well it will work on *future test data*

## An important clarification

::: callout-important
In previous lectures, we've used $R_n(\hat f)$ to denote risk. 

Confusing: the $\hat \mu$ argument looks like a *trained predictor*, so $R_n(\hat f)$ looks like a function of *training data*. **Not true!**

We will just avoid this confusion from now on and use $R_n$ for risk.

## Risk vs. Test Error: Warmup in 1D

- Model: $\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \sim \mathcal N(\mu, 1), \quad \mu\in\R\}$, loss $\ell(y,\hat y) = (y-\hat y)^2$
- Training Data: $Y_i\in\R$ from some unknown "true" $P_0 \in \mathcal{P}$ (i.e., "true" $\mu_0$)
- Predictor: *function of training data* $\hat\mu : \R^n \to \R$
    - e.g., scaled empirical average $\hat\mu(Y_{1:n}) = \alpha\frac{1}{n}\sum_{n=1}^N Y_n$ for $\alpha > 0$

. . . 

- **Risk** $R_n$: expected loss over *both* training and test data $R_n = E[\ell(Y,\hat\mu(Y_{1:n}))]$
    - function of true dist $P_0$ and predictor *function* $\hat\mu(\cdot)$
    - averages over randomness in training data

. . . 

- **Test Error** $T_n$: expected loss over *only* test data $T_n(\hat\mu) = E[\ell(Y,\hat\mu(Y_{1:n})) | Y_{1:n}]$
    - function of true dist $P_0$, predictor *function* $\hat\mu(\cdot)$, **and training data**
    - training data (and trained predictor) are known/fixed 

## Risk vs. Test Error: Warmup in 1D

- Model: $\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \sim \mathcal N(\mu, 1), \quad \mu\in\R\}$, loss $\ell(y,\hat y) = (y-\hat y)^2$
- Training Data: $Y_i\in\R$ from some unknown "true" $P_0 \in \mathcal{P}$ (i.e., "true" $\mu_0$)
- Predictor: scaled empirical average $\hat\mu(Y_{1:n}) = \alpha \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ for a fixed $\alpha > 0$


[(What can the risk and test error depend on?)]{.secondary}

. . .

$$ R_n = E[(Y - \hat\mu(Y_{1:n}))^2] = \underbrace{1}_{\text{irr.}} + \underbrace{\mu^2_0(\alpha-1)^2}_{\text{bias}^2}+\underbrace{\alpha^2/n}_{\text{variance}}$$

. . .

$$ T_n = E[(Y - \hat\mu(Y_{1:n}))^2 |Y_{1:n}] = 1 + \left(\mu_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\right)^2$$

. . .

- $R_n$ is a function of the true distribution ($\mu_0$) and predictor ($\alpha$); not training data!
- $T_n$ is a function of $\mu_0$, $\alpha$ *and* training data 

## Risk vs. Test Error: Regression

- Model: $\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \mid X \sim \mathcal N( f(X), 1), \quad f(x)=ax, \, \text{for } a\in\R \}$
- Training Data: $X_i,Y_i\in\R$ pairs from some unknown "true" $P_0 \in \mathcal{P}$ ("true" $a_0$)
- Predictor: a *function of the training data and a new test input* $\hat f : \R^n\times \R^{n} \times \R \to \R$
    - e.g., the function $\hat f(X_{1:n},Y_{1:n},x) = \beta \frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} x$ for $\beta > 0$

. . .

- **Risk** $R_n$: avg loss over *both* training and test data $R_n = E[\ell(Y, \hat f(X_{1:n}, Y_{1:n}, X))]$

. . .

- **Test Error** $T_n$: avg loss over *only* test data $T_n = E[\ell(Y, \hat f(Y_{1:n}, X_{1:n},X)) | Y_{1:n},X_{1:n}]$
    - training data fixed/known

## Risk vs. Test Error: Regression

- Model: $\mathcal{P} = \{ P: \quad Y \mid X \sim \mathcal N( f(X), 1), \quad f(x)=ax, \, \text{for } a\in\R \}$ ("true" value $a_0$)
- Predictor: the function $\hat f(X_{1:n}, Y_{1:n}, x) = \beta \frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} x$

R_n = E[(Y - \hat f(X))^2]

\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

$$ T_n = E[(Y - \hat f(X))^2|X_{1:n},Y_{1:n}] = 1 +  E[X^2]\left(a_0 - \beta\frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2-X_1}\right)^2 $$

. . .

- Risk $R_n$ depends only on $a_0, \beta$ and $X$-marginal distribution
- Test error $T_n$ depends on training data too!

## Estimating risk

We can't compute $R_n$ in practice (we don't know the true data distribution)

Can we estimate risk ($\hat R_n$) with data? How do we measure the quality of our estimate?

. . .

$$E[(R_n - \hat R_n)^2]$$
[(What is the expectation with respect to?)]{.secondary}

. . .

- $R_n$ is just a fixed value (we already averaged over test data and training data)
- $\hat R_n$ depends only on training data
- So the expectation is with respect to our training dataset

. . .

As before, we can decompose the error of our risk estimator into **bias** and **variance**

$$
E[(R_n - \hat R_n)^2] = \underbrace{( R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{E[( \hat R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2]}_{\text{variance}}
$$

## Estimating risk: empirical risk
$$
\text{Recall: }E[(R_n - \hat R_n)^2] = \underbrace{( R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{E[( \hat R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2]}_{\text{variance}}
$$

- **Empirical risk:** just use the training loss $\hat R_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(Y_i, \hat f(X_i))$


[(What is the bias and variance with a *really flexible model*?)]{.secondary}

. . .

- If our model is so flexible that it can nearly fit all data always, then $\hat R_n \approx 0$
- $\text{Variance} = E[( \hat R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2] \approx E[(0 - 0)^2] = 0$ 
- $\text{Bias}^2 = ( R_n - E[\hat R_n(\hat f)])^2 \approx ( R_n - 0 ) = R_n$

. . .

[(Is that good or bad?)]{.secondary}

## Estimating risk: holdout sets
$$
\text{Recall: }E[(R_n - \hat R_n)^2] = \underbrace{( R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{E[( \hat R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2]}_{\text{variance}}
$$
**Holdout:** train $\hat f$ with $n-m$ data, estimate with $m$ data:  $\hat R_n = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m} \ell(Y_j, \hat f(X_j))$ 

. . . 

- bias [(increasing, decreasing, or either with $m$?)]{.secondary}
$$
\text{Bias}^2 = (R_n - R_{n-m})^2
$$

. . . 

- variance [(increasing, decreasing, or either with $m$?)]{.secondary}

$$
\text{Variance}
= \underbrace{\frac{1}{m}E[(\tilde \ell - E[\tilde\ell| \hat f])^2]}_{\text{estimation variance}}
+ \underbrace{E[(E[\tilde \ell| \hat f] - R_{n-m})^2]}_{\text{training variance}} \quad \text{where }\tilde \ell = \ell(Y_1, \hat f(X_1))
$$

<!-- 
= \underbrace{E[(\hat R_n - E[\hat R_n | \hat f])^2]}_{\text{estimation variance}}  + \underbrace{E[(E[ \hat R_n | \hat f] - E[\hat R_n])^2]}_{\text{training variance}}
-->

## Estimating risk: leave-one-out cross-val. (LOO-CV)

- **LOO-CV estimate:** $\hat R_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \tilde R_i$, where:
    - Remove the first observation and train ($\hat f_1$), estimate $\tilde R_1 = \ell(Y_1, \hat f_1(X_1))$
    - Remove the second observation and train ($\hat f_2$), estimate $\tilde R_2 = \ell(Y_2, \hat f_2(X_2))$
    - Wash, rinse, repeat...

. . .

[(Bias? Hint: if we train with $n-m$, we get $(R_n - R_{n-m})^2$...)]{.secondary}

. . .

- Bias is $(R_n - R_{n-1})^2$ -- quite small!
- Variance is small too! Roughly: $E[( \hat R_n - E[\hat R_n])^2]\approx \frac{1}{n} E[(\tilde R_1 - R_{n-1})^2]$
    - assumption: ignoring $\tilde R_j$, $\tilde R_k$ covariance for $j\neq k$
    - reasonable if $n$ large enough that one data point doesn't influence $\hat f$ too much

. . .

- **major downside:**  have to train $n$ models (*super* expensive!)

## Cross Validation

One reason that $\widehat{R}_n(\widehat{f})$ is bad is that we are using the same data to pick $\widehat{f}$ __AND__ to estimate $R_n$.

"Validation set" fixes this, but holds out a particular, fixed block of data we pretend mimics the "test data"

Our validation error $\tilde{R}_m(\widehat{f})$ is a random estimator.\
[(The split we use to divide our data into training versus validation is random.)]{.secondary}

. . .

\
A random estimator has _variance_.
We can reduce this variance by averageing over multiple splits.


## Cross Validation Example

What if we set aside one observation, say the first one $(y_1, x_1)$:

- We estimate $\widehat{f}^{(1)}$ without using the first observation.
- We estimate $\widetilde{R}_1(\widehat{f}^{(1)})$ using the held-out first observation.

$$\widetilde{R}_1(\widehat{f}^{(1)}) = (y_1 -\widehat{f}^{(1)}(x_1))^2.$$
[(Why the notation $\widetilde{R}_1$? Because we're estimating the risk with 1 observation. )]{.secondary}

---

But that was only one data point $(y_1, x_1)$. Why stop there?

Do the same with $(y_2, x_2)$!

$$\widetilde{R}_1(\widehat{f}^{(2)}) = (y_2 -\widehat{f}^{(2)}(x_2))^2.$$
We can keep doing this until we try it for every data point.

. . .

$$\mbox{LOO-CV} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{R}_1(\widehat{f}^{(i)}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n 
(y_i - \widehat{f}^{(i)}(x_i))^2$$
This is [__leave-one-out cross validation__]{.secondary}

## Problems with LOO-CV

🤮 Each held out set is small $(n=1)$. Therefore, the variance of the Squared Error of each prediction is high.

🤮 The training sets overlap. This is bad. 

- Usually, averaging reduces variance: $\Var{\overline{X}} = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n \Var{X_i} = \frac{1}{n}\Var{X_1}.$
- But only if the variables are independent. If not, then $\Var{\overline{X}} = \frac{1}{n^2}\Var{ \sum_{i=1}^n X_i} = \frac{1}{n}\Var{X_1} + \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i\neq j} \Cov{X_i}{X_j}.$
- Since the training sets overlap a lot, that covariance can be pretty big.
    
🤮 We have to estimate this model $n$ times.

🎉 Bias is low because we used almost all the data to fit the model: $E[\mbox{LOO-CV}] = R_{n-1}$

## K-fold CV

$K$-fold cross validation finds a *decent* tradeoff between these options.

The idea of $K$-fold CV is 

1. Divide the data into $K$ groups. 
1. Leave one group out and train with the remaining $K-1$ groups.
1. Test on the held-out group. Calculate an average risk over these $\sim n/K$ data.
1. Repeat for all $K$ groups.
1. Average the average risks.

## K-fold CV: illustration

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 10
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NA, NA, ylim = c(0, 5), xlim = c(0, 10), bty = "n", yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n")
rect(0, .1 + c(0, 2, 3, 4), 10, .9 + c(0, 2, 3, 4), col = blue, density = 10)
rect(c(0, 1, 2, 9), rev(.1 + c(0, 2, 3, 4)), c(1, 2, 3, 10), 
     rev(.9 + c(0, 2, 3, 4)), col = red, density = 10)
points(c(5, 5, 5), 1 + 1:3 / 4, pch = 19)
text(.5 + c(0, 1, 2, 9), .5 + c(4, 3, 2, 0), c("1", "2", "3", "K"), cex = 3, 
     col = red)
text(6, 4.5, "Training data", cex = 3, col = blue)
text(2, 1.5, "Validation data", cex = 3, col = red)
```

## K-fold CV vs. LOO CV

- 🎉 Less costly than LOO CV (i.e., actually possible; only need to train $K$ times)
- 💩 K-fold CV has higher sq. bias $(R_n - R_{n(1-1/K)})^2$ than LOO CV $(R_n - R_{n-1})^2$
- a bit painful to compare variance...
    - I hereby invoke the sacred incantation: "this exercise is left to the reader"

The overall risk $R_n$ depends on $n$.

:::callout-tip
In practice, most people just default to using 5-fold or 10-fold. This is probably fine in most cases.

## Trick

__For certain "nice" models__ of the form
$$\widehat{y}_i = h_i(\mathbf{X})^\top \mathbf{y}$$
for some vector $h_i$, one can show 

$$\mbox{LOO-CV} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(y_i -\widehat{y}_i)^2}{(1-[\boldsymbol h_i(x_i)]_{i})^2}.$$
(Proof: tedious algebra. QED)

which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but might - in a fit of rage - assign as homework to belligerent students.) 

. . .

* This trick means that you only have to fit the model once rather than $n$ times!

```{r}
cv_nice <- function(mdl) mean( (residuals(mdl) / (1 - hatvalues(mdl)))^2 )
