## Mean squared error (MSE)

Last time... [Ordinary Least Squares]{.secondary}

$$\widehat\beta = \argmin_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n ( y_i - x_i^\top \beta )^2.$$


"Find the $\beta$ which minimizes the sum of squared errors."

$$\widehat\beta = \arg\min_\beta \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n ( y_i - x_i^\top \beta )^2.$$

"Find the beta which minimizes the mean squared error."


## Forget all that...

That's "stuff that seems like a good idea"

And it is for many reasons

This class is about those reasons, and the "statistics" behind it

. . .

#### Methods for "Statistical" Learning


Starts with "what is a model?"

## What is a model?

In statistics, "model" has a mathematical meaning.

Distinct from "algorithm" or "procedure".

Defining a model often leads to a procedure/algorithm with good properties.

Sometimes procedure/algorithm $\Rightarrow$ a specific model.

> Statistics (the field) tells me how to understand when different procedures
> are desirable. 

When are certain models appropriate?

> One definition of "Statistical Learning" is the "statistics behind the procedure".

## Statistical models 101

We observe data $Z_1,\ Z_2,\ \ldots,\ Z_n$ generated by some probability
distribution $P$. We want to use the data to learn about $P$. 

> A [statistical model]{.secondary} is a set of distributions $\mathcal{P}$.


Some examples:

  1. $\P = \{ 0 < p < 1 : P(z=1)=p,\ P(z=0)=1-p\}$.
  2. $\P = \{ \beta \in \R^p,\ \sigma>0 : Y \sim N(X^\top\beta,\sigma^2),\  X\mbox{ fixed}\}$.
  2. $\P = \{\mbox{all CDF's }F\}$.
  3. $\P = \{\mbox{all smooth functions } f: \R^p \rightarrow \R : Z_i = (X_i, Y_i),\ E[Y_i] = f(X_i) \}$
  
## Statistical models 

We want to use the data to [select]{.secondary} a distribution $P$ that probably 
generated the data.

. . . 

#### My model:

$$
\P = \{ P(z=1)=p,\ P(z=0)=1-p,\ 0 < p < 1 \}
$$
  
* To completely characterize $P$, I just need to estimate $p$.

* Need to assume that $P \in \P$. 

* This assumption is mostly empty: _need independent, can't see $z=12$._

## Statistical models 

We observe data $Z_i=(Y_i,X_i)$ generated by some probability
distribution $P$. We want to use the data to learn about $P$. 

. . . 

#### My model

$$
\P = \{ \beta \in \R^p, \sigma>0 : Y_i \given X_i=x_i \sim N(x_i^\top\beta,\ \sigma^2) \}.
$$

  
* To completely characterize $P$, I just need to estimate $\beta$ and $\sigma$.

* Need to assume that $P\in\P$.

* This time, I have to assume a lot more: 
_(conditional) Linearity, independence, conditional Gaussian noise,_
_no ignored variables, no collinearity, etc._


## Statistical models, unfamiliar example

We observe data $Z_i \in \R$ generated by some probability
distribution $P$. We want to use the data to learn about $P$. 

#### My model

$$
\P = \{ Z_i \textrm{ has a density function } f \}.
$$

  
* To completely characterize $P$, I need to estimate $f$.

* In fact, we can't hope to do this.


[Revised Model 1]{.secondary} - $\P=\{ Z_i \textrm{ has a density function } f : \int (f'')^2 dx < M \}$

[Revised Model 2]{.secondary} - $\P=\{ Z_i \textrm{ has a density function } f : \int (f'')^2 dx < K < M \}$

[Revised Model 3]{.secondary} - $\P=\{ Z_i \textrm{ has a density function } f : \int |f'| dx <  M \}$

* Each of these suggests different ways of estimating $f$


## Assumption Lean Regression

Imagine $Z = (Y, X) \sim P$ with $Y \in \R$ and $\mathbf{X} = (1, X_1, \ldots, X_p)^\top$.

We are interested in the _conditional_ distribution $P_{Y|\mathbf{X}}$

Suppose we think that there is _some_ function of interest which relates $Y$ and $X$.

Let's call this function $\mu(\mathbf{X})$ for the moment. How do we estimate $\mu$? What is $\mu$?

::: aside
See [Berk et al. _Assumption Lean Regression_](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1592781).
:::


. . . 

To make this precise, we 

* Have a model $\P$.
* Need to define a "good" functional $\mu$.
* Let's loosely define "good" as

> Given a new (random) $Z$, $\mu(\mathbf{X})$ is "close" to $Y$.

## Evaluating "close"

We need more functions.
  
Choose some _loss function_  $\ell$ that measures how close $\mu$ and $Y$ are.

## Start with (Expected) Squared Error

Let's try to minimize the _expected_ squared error (MSE).

Claim: $\mu(X) = \Expect{Y\ \vert\ X}$ minimizes MSE.

That is, for any $r(X)$, $\Expect{(Y - \mu(X))^2} \leq \Expect{(Y-r(X))^2}$.


. . .

Proof of Claim:


\begin{aligned}
\Expect{(Y-r(X))^2} 
&= \Expect{(Y- \mu(X) + \mu(X) - r(X))^2}\\
&= \Expect{(Y- \mu(X))^2} + \Expect{(\mu(X) - r(X))^2} \\
&\quad +2\Expect{(Y- \mu(X))(\mu(X) - r(X))}\\
&=\Expect{(Y- \mu(X))^2} + \Expect{(\mu(X) - r(X))^2} \\
&\quad +2(\mu(X) - r(X))\Expect{(Y- \mu(X))}\\
&=\Expect{(Y- \mu(X))^2} + \Expect{(\mu(X) - r(X))^2} + 0\\
&\geq \Expect{(Y- \mu(X))^2}
\end{aligned}




## The regression function

Sometimes people call this solution:


$$\mu(X) = \Expect{Y \ \vert\  X}$$


the regression function. (But don't forget that it depended on $\ell$.)

If we __assume__ that $\mu(x) = \Expect{Y \ \vert\  X=x} = x^\top \beta$, then we get back exactly OLS.

. . .

But why should we assume $\mu(x) = x^\top \beta$?


## Brief aside {background-color="#97D4E9"}

Some notation / terminology

* "Hats" on things mean "estimates", so $\widehat{\mu}$ is an estimate of $\mu$

* Parameters are "properties of the model", so $f_X(x)$ or $\mu$ or $\Var{Y}$

* Random variables like $X$, $Y$, $Z$ may eventually become data, $x$, $y$, $z$, once observed.

* "Estimating" means "using observations to estimate _parameters_"

* "Predicting" means "using observations to predict _future data_"

* Often, there is a parameter whose estimate will provide a prediction.

. . .


> This last point can lead to confusion.



## The regression function


In mathematics: $\mu(x) = \Expect{Y \ \vert\  X=x}$.

In words: 

[Regression with squared-error loss is really about estimating the (conditional) mean.]{.secondary}

1. If $Y\sim \textrm{N}(\mu,\ 1)$, our best guess for a __new__ $Y$ is $\mu$.  

2. For regression, we let the mean $(\mu)$ __depend__ on $X$.  
3. Think of $Y\sim \textrm{N}(\mu(X),\ 1)$, then conditional on $X=x$, our best guess for a __new__ $Y$ is $\mu(x)$ 

[whatever this function $\mu$ is]


## Anything strange?

For any two variables $Y$ and $X$, we can __always__ write

$$Y \ \vert\  X = E[Y\given X] + (Y - E[Y\given X]) = \mu(X) + \eta(X)$$

such that $\Expect{\eta(X)}=0$.

. . .

* Suppose, $\mu(X)=\mu_0$ (constant in $X$), are $Y$ and $X$ independent?

. . .

* Suppose $Y$ and $X$ are independent, is $\mu(X)=\mu_0$?

. . .

* For more practice on this see the 
[Fun Worksheet on Theory](../handouts/worksheet.pdf) and
[solutions](../handouts/worksheet-solution.pdf)

* In this course, I do not expect you to be able to create this math, but understanding and explaining it [is]{.secondary} important.


# Making predictions



## What do we mean by good predictions?


We make observations and then attempt to "predict" new, unobserved data.

Sometimes this is the same as estimating the (conditional) mean. 
  
Mostly, we observe $(y_1,x_1),\ \ldots,\ (y_n,x_n)$, and we want some way to predict $Y$ from $X$.



## Expected test MSE 


For _regression_ applications, we will use squared-error loss:

$R_n(\widehat{\mu}) = \Expect{(Y-\widehat{\mu}(X))^2}$

. . .

I'm giving this a name, $R_n$ for ease. 

Different than text.

This is _expected test MSE_.



## Example: Estimating/Predicting the (conditional) mean


Suppose we know that we want to predict a quantity $Y$, 

where $\Expect{Y}= \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\Var{Y} = 1$.  


Our data is $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$

Claim: We want to estimate $\mu$. 

. . . 

Why?


## Estimating the mean

* Let $\widehat{Y}=\overline{Y}_n$ be the sample mean.  
* We can ask about the _estimation risk_ (since we're estimating $\mu$):

::: flex

::: w-50
  
\begin{aligned}
    E[(\overline{Y}_n-\mu)^2]
    &= E[\overline{Y}_n^2]
    -2\mu E[\overline{Y}_n] + \mu^2 \\ 
    &= \mu^2 + \frac{1}{n} - 2\mu^2 +
    \mu^2\\ &= \frac{1}{n}
\end{aligned}

:::

::: w-50

[Useful trick]{.primary}

For any $Z$,

$\Var{Z} = \Expect{Z^2} - \Expect{Z}^2$.

Therefore:

$\Expect{Z^2} = \Var{Z} + \Expect{Z}^2$.

:::
:::
  


## Predicting new Y's

* Let $\widehat{Y}=\overline{Y}_n$ be the sample mean.    
* What is the _prediction risk_ of $\overline{Y}$?    



::: flex
::: w-50
\begin{aligned}
  R_n(\overline{Y}_n) 
  &= \E[(\overline{Y}_n-Y)^2]\\ 
  &= \E[\overline{Y}_{n}^{2}] -2\E[\overline{Y}_n Y] + \E[Y^2] \\ 
  &= \mu^2 + \frac{1}{n} - 2\mu^2 + \mu^2 + 1 \\ 
  &= 1 + \frac{1}{n} 
\end{aligned}

:::
::: w-50

[Tricks:]{.primary}

Used the variance thing again.

If $X$ and $Z$ are independent, then $\Expect{XZ} = \Expect{X}\Expect{Z}$

:::
:::

## Predicting new Y's

  
* What is the prediction risk of guessing $Y=0$?

* You can probably guess that this is a stupid idea.

* Let's show why it's stupid.

\begin{aligned}
        R_n(0) &= \E[(0-Y)^2] = 1 + \mu^2
\end{aligned}



## Predicting new Y's


What is the prediction risk of guessing $Y=\mu$?


This is a great idea, but we don't know $\mu$.

Let's see what happens anyway.

\begin{aligned}
        R_n(\mu) &= \E[(Y-\mu)^2]= 1
\end{aligned}



## Risk relations

  
Prediction risk: $R_n(\overline{Y}_n) = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$    

Estimation risk: $E[(\overline{Y}_n - \mu)^2] =  \frac{1}{n}$  

There is actually a nice interpretation here:

1. The common $1/n$ term is $\Var{\overline{Y}_n}$  
2. The extra factor of $1$ in the prediction risk is _irreducible error_

    * $Y$ is a random variable, and hence noisy. 
    * We can never eliminate it's intrinsic variance.  
    * In other words, even if we knew $\mu$, we could never get closer than $1$, on average.

Intuitively, $\overline{Y}_n$ is the obvious thing to do.
 
But what about unintuitive things...
