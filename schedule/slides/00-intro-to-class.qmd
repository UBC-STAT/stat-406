## Wait, there's two of you?

*Geoff & Trevor are co-teaching this course!*

<br>

Think of the two of us as interchangeable people. \
(It's not that hard. We're very similar.)

- We will both be present at (almost) all lectures
- We will roughly alternate who is giving the lecture
- We are both in charge of course material / course policies / grades / etc.

## Philosophy of the class

We and the TAs are here to [help you learn]{.secondary}. Ask questions.

We encourage [engagement]{.secondary}, [curiosity]{.secondary} and [generosity]{.secondary}

We favour [steady work]{.secondary} through the term (vs. sleeping until finals)

. . .

The assessments attempt to reflect this ethos.

## More philosophy

When the term ends, we want

-   You to be better at coding.
-   You to have an understanding of the variety of methods available to do prediction and data analysis.
-   You to articulate their strengths and weaknesses.
-   You to be able to choose between different methods using **your intuition** and **the data**.

. . .

We do not want

-   You to be under undo stress
-   You to feel the need to cheat, plagiarize, or drop the course
-   You to feel treated unfairly.

## 

We promise

-   To grade/mark fairly. Good faith effort will be rewarded.
-   To be flexible. This semester (like the last 4) is different for everyone.
-   To understand and adapt to issues.

. . .

[We do not promise that you will all get the grade you want.]{.secondary}


<!--## On COVID-->
## COVID Policies (TL; DR)

-   We encourage you to wear a mask if you want

-   Do [NOT]{.secondary} come to class if you are possibly sick

-   Be kind and considerate to others

-   The Marking scheme is flexible enough to allow some missed classes

::: notes
-   We'll talk about lots of ML models
-   But our focus is on how to "understand" everything in this diagram.
-   How do we interpret? Evaluate? Choose a model?
-   What are the implications / assumptions implied by our choices?
-   Deep understanding of statistics helps with intuition.

## What this course is

- ~~How to use scikit-learn / PyTorch~~
- ~~Everything there is to know about machine learning~~
- ~~The hypeist new machine leraning models (generative AI)~~
- The fundamentals for developing deep intuitions/understanding about machine learning

## Predictive models

<br><br>

### 1. Preprocessing

centering / scaling / factors-to-dummies / basis expansion / missing values / dimension reduction / discretization / transformations

### 2. Model fitting

Which box do you use?

### 3. Prediction

Repeat all the preprocessing on new data. But be careful.

### 4. Postprocessing, interpretation, and evaluation

## 6 modules

::: flex
::: w-50
0.  Review (today and next week)
1.  Model accuracy and selection
2.  Regularization, smoothing, trees
3.  Classifiers
4.  Modern techniques (classification and regression)
5.  Unsupervised learning
:::

::: w-50
-   Each module is approximately 2 weeks long

-   Each module is based on a collection of readings and lectures

-   Each module (except the review) has a homework assignment
:::

## Assessments

[Effort-based]{.fourth-colour}

Total across three components: 65 points, any way you want

1.  [Labs]{.secondary}, up to 20 points (2 each)
2.  [Assignments]{.secondary}, up to 50 points (10 each)
3.  [Clickers]{.secondary}, up to 10 points


`effort_grade = max(65, labs + assignments + clickers)`

<br>

. . .

[Knowledge-based]{.fourth-colour}

Final Exam, 35 points

## Why this scheme?

-   You stay on top of the material

-   You come to class and participate

-   You gain coding practice in the labs

-   You work hard on the assignments

::: callout-tip
## Most of this is Effort Based

work hard, guarantee yourself 65%
:::



## Time expectations per week:

-   Coming to class -- 3 hours

-   Reading the book -- 1 hour

-   Labs -- 1 hour

-   Homework -- 4 hours

-   Study / thinking / playing -- 1 hour

## Labs / Assignments

The goal is to "Do the work"

::: flex
::: w-50
[Assignments]{.secondary}

* Not easy, especially the first 2, especially if you are unfamiliar with R / Rmarkdown / ggplot

* You may revise to raise your score to 7/10, see [Syllabus](https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406/syllabus/). Only if you lose 3+ for content (penalties can't be redeemed).

* Don't leave these for the last minute

:::

::: w-50
[Labs]{.secondary}

* Labs should give you practice, allow for questions with the TAs.

* They are due at 2300 on the day of your lab, lightly graded.

* You may do them at home, but you must submit individually (in lab, you may share submission)

* Labs are lightly graded

:::

:::

## Late policy

If you have not submitted your lab/assignment by the time grading starts,
you will get a 0.

. . .

<br>

| **When you submit**     | **Likelihood that your submission gets a 0** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before 11pm on due date\ (i.e. on time) | 0%                                        |
| 11:01pm on due date     | 0.01%                                                       |
| 9am after due date      | 50%                                                        |
| 2 weeks after due date  | 99.99999999%                                               |


## Late policy

We will only make exceptions when you have grounds for academic consession.
(See the [UBC policy](https://science.ubc.ca/students/concession).)

:::callout-tip
**Remember**: you can still get a "perfect" effort grade even if you get a 0 on one assignment.
:::

## Clickers

-   Questions are similar to the Final

-   0 points for skipping, 2 points for trying, 4 points for correct

    -   Average of 3 = 10 points (the max)
    -   Average of 2 = 5 points
    -   Average of 1 = 0 points
    - `total = max(0, min(5 * points / N - 5, 10))`

-   Be sure to sync your device in Canvas.

::: callout-important
## Don't do this!

Average \< 1 drops your Final Mark 1 letter grade.

A- becomes B-, C+ becomes D.
:::

## Final Exam

-   Scheduled by the university.

-   It is hard

-   The median last year was 50% $\Rightarrow$ A-

[Philosophy:]{.secondary}

> If you put in the effort, you're guaranteed a C+.  
> But to get an A+, you should really deeply understand the material.

No penalty for skipping the final.

If you're cool with C+ and hate tests, then that's fine.


## Advice

-   Skipping HW makes it difficult to get to 65

-   Come to class!

-   Yes it's at 8am. We hate it too.

-   To compensate, we will record the class and post to Canvas.

-   In terms of last year's class, attendance in lecture and active engagement (asking questions, coming to office hours, etc.) is the best predictor of success.

::: w-50
* All coding in `R`

* Suggest you use **RStudio** IDE

* See <https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406/> for instructions

* It tells you how to install what you will need, hopefully all at once, for the whole Term.

* We will use R and we assume some background knowledge.

* Links to useful supplementary resources are available on the website.

<hr>

-   All lectures will be recorded and posted

-   We cannot guarantee that they will all work properly (sometimes we mess it up)

## Some more words

-   Lectures are hard. It's 8am, everyone's tired.

-   Coding is hard. We hope you'll get better at it.

-   We strongly urge you to get up at the same time everyday.
    <!--My plan is to go to the gym on MWF.-->
    It's really hard to sleep in until 10 on MWF and make class at 8 on T/Th.

<hr>

Let's be kind and understanding to each other.

We have to give you a grade, but we want that grade to reflect your learning and effort, not other junk.
