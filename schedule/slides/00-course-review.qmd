## Office hours and such 

(also in the Canvas announcement)

1. Yes, there is lab as usual tomorrow. (But no Zoom OH)
1. Homework 5 due tonight.
1. Office hours next week:
    - Monday 5-6pm on Zoom (use the link on Canvas, TA)
    - Tuesday 3-4:30pm in ESB 4192 (me)
    - Wednesday 10-11am in ESB 4192 (TA)
    - Thursday 10-11am in ESB 3174 (me)
    - Friday 2-3pm on Zoom (use the link on Canvas, TA)

[Final Exam on Monday, December 18 from 12-2pm]{.secondary}

## Grades etc.

- Effort score done as soon as possible
- HW 5, aiming for Friday Dec 15, but no guarantees
- Clickers and Labs should be done soon
- The Final is autograded
- It usually takes me a few days to get the final grades in
- Generally, no curves, no roundin' up, etc.

b. Is the set of points where $P(Y=1|X) / P(Y=0|X) = P(Y=1) / P(Y=0)$
c. Is the set of points where $P(Y=1|X) / P(Y=0|X) = P(Y=0) / P(Y=1)$
d. Is linear for all discriminant analysis predictors
