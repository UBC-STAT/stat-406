## Office hours and such 

(also in the Canvas announcement)

1. Yes, there is lab as usual tomorrow. (But no Zoom OH)
1. Homework 5 due tonight.
1. Office hours next week:
    - Monday 5-6pm on Zoom (use the link on Canvas, TA)
    - Tuesday 3-4:30pm in ESB 4192 (me)
    - Wednesday 10-11am in ESB 4192 (TA)
    - Thursday 10-11am in ESB 3174 (me)
    - Friday 2-3pm on Zoom (use the link on Canvas, TA)

[Final Exam on Monday, December 18 from 12-2pm]{.secondary}

## Grades etc.

- Effort score done as soon as possible
- HW 5, aiming for Friday Dec 15, but no guarantees
- Clickers and Labs should be done soon
- The Final is autograded
- It usually takes me a few days to get the final grades in
- Generally, no curves, no roundin' up, etc.

## Big picture

- What is a model?
- How do we evaluate models?
- How do we decide which models to use?
- How do we improve models?

## General stuff

- Linear algebra (SVD, matrix multiplication, matrix properties, etc.)
- Optimization (derivitive + set to 0, gradient descent, Newton's method, etc.)
- Probability (conditional probability, Bayes rule, etc.)
- Statistics (likelihood, MLE, confidence intervals, etc.)


## 1. Model selection

- What is a statistical model?
- What is the goal of model selection?
- What is the difference between training and test error?
- What is overfitting?
- What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
- What is the difference between AIC / BIC / CV / Held-out validation?

## 2. Regression

- What do we mean by regression?
- What is the difference between linear and non-linear regression?
- What are linear smoothers and why do we care?
- What is feature creation?
- What is regularization?
- What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?

## 3. Classification

- What is classification? Bayes Rule?
- What are linear decision boundaries?
- Compare logistic regression to discriminant analysis.
- What are the positives and negatives of trees?
- What about loss functions? How do we measure performance?


## 4. Modern methods

- What is the difference between bagging and boosting?
- What is the point of the bootstrap?
- What is the difference between random forests and bagging?
- How do we understand Neural Networks?

## 5. Unsupervised learning

- What is unsupervised learning?
