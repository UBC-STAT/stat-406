<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:<br />
STAT 306 or CPSC 340</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h3>

<p>This is a course in statistical learning methods. Based on the theory of
linear models covered in Stat 306, this course will focus on applying many
techniques of data analysis methods to interesting datasets.</p>

<p>The course combines analysis with methodology and
computational aspects. It treats both the “art” of understanding
unfamiliar data and the “science” of analyzing that data in terms of 
statistical properties. The focus will be on practical aspects of methodology and intuition
to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and
approaches to problems in their own lives.</p>

<p>This is not a “how to program” course, nor a “tour of machine learning methods”.
Rather, this course is about how to understand some ML methods. STAT 306 tends
to give background in many of the tools of understanding as well as working with
already-written <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> packages. On the other hand, CPSC 340 focuses introduces
many methods with a focus on “from-scratch” implementation (in Julia or Python).
This course will try to bridge this gap. Depending on which course you took, you
may be more or less skilled in some aspects than in others. That’s ok and
expected.</p>

<h3 id="course-assesssment-opportunities">Course assesssment opportunities</h3>

<p>15 Reading checks and worksheets<br />
20 Assignments<br />
10 Mini quizzes<br />
20 Project<br />
35 Final exam</p>

<h4 id="reading-checks-and-worksheets">Reading checks and worksheets</h4>

<p>These are two different components intended to keep you on track. Both are to be
submitted via pull requests in your personal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">worksheets-&lt;username&gt;</code> repo (see
the <a href="/computing/">computing tab</a> for descriptions on how to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Reading checks</strong> are simply extracts of the code from the online <a href="https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406-worksheets">course
notes</a>. The code for each topic
has two lines removed. You should read the notes and work through the code you
have, executing the commands and examining the output. The purpose is for you to
engage in <em>active</em> rather than <em>passive</em> reading. When you discover the missing
lines, simply copy the correct lines into your file. That’s it. These are simple
and worth 1 point each up to a maximum of 20 points.</p>

<p><strong>Worksheets</strong> are more thorough. They typically have a few questions for you to
answer or code to implement. These will often be done <em>during class</em> or <em>lab</em>
periods. But you can do them on your own as well. These are worth 2 points each
up to a maximum of 20 points.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong> To get all 15%, you need to accumulate 30 total points during the
semester. This can be done in any combination of reading check points and
worksheets (respecting the limit). Of course you can (and should!) do more, but
this isn’t required. You may submit up to 5 points at a time in a pull request
and you may submit only 5 points per week. In your PR, there must be as many
commits as points. So a PR with 2 reading checks and 1 worksheet should have at
least 4 commits (probably one for each check and 2 for the worksheet). This will
be lightly enforced initially. The last day to open a PR is December 5.</p>

<p><strong>Marking</strong> Reading checks get 1 if correct and 0 otherwise. If you get 0, you
can’t resubmit this check (but you can submit others). Worksheets get 2 points
when correct. Sometimes the graders will ask for changes in their PR review. If
they do, implement the corrections, make another commit, and re-request the
review. Once correct, you receive 2 points. Only one additional review will be
allowed per submission. If egregious errors remain (in the opinion of the
grader) then you will not receive credit (but you can submit another worksheet).
The overriding theme here is “if you put in the effort, you’ll get all the
points.</p>

<p>It’s important here to recognize just how important active participation in
these activities is. You learn by doing, and this is your opportunity to learn
in a low-stakes environment. One thing you’ll learn, for example, is that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3737">all
animals urinate in 21 seconds</a>.<sup id="fnref:note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:note" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>

<p>There will be 5 assignments, you should complete 4. These are submitted via pull
request similar to the worksheets. You are allowed <em>one late class period</em>. This
means that of the 4 assignments you submit, one can be submitted late, up until
the next class meeting. This policy (drop 1, submit 1 late) is intended to
accommodate any and all issues. It is not a “pad your mark” policy. If you
submit the first 4 assignments, we won’t mark the fifth. The TAs have a lot on
their plate and “marking dropped assignments” takes a lot of work. Both policies
are “no questions asked”. Simply turn it in late or not at all and we’ll take
care of the rest. You don’t need to justify anything.</p>

<p><strong>Policy on collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Discussing assignments with your classmates is allowed and encouraged, but it is
important that every student get practice working on these problems. This means
that <strong>all the work you turn in must be your own</strong>. The general policy on
homework collaboration is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must first make a serious effort to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>If you are stuck after doing so, you may ask for help from another student.
You may discuss strategies to solve the problem, but you may not look at
their code, nor may they spell out the solution to you step-by-step.</li>
  <li>Once you have gotten help, you must write your own solution individually. You
must disclose, in your GitHub pull request, the names of anyone from whom you
got help.</li>
  <li>This also applies in reverse: if someone approaches you for help, you must
not provide it unless they have already attempted to solve the problem, and
you may not share your code or spell out the solution step-by-step.</li>
</ol>

<p>These rules also apply to getting help from other people such as friends not in
the course (try the problem first, discuss strategies, not step-by-step
solutions, acknowledge those from whom you received help).</p>

<p>You may not use homework help websites, Stack Overflow, and so on under any
circumstances.</p>

<p>You can always, of course, ask me for help on Slack. And public Slack
<strong>questions</strong> are allowed and encouraged.</p>

<p>You may also use external sources (books, websites, papers, …) to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look up programming language documentation, find useful packages, find
explanations for error messages, or remind yourself about the syntax for some
feature. I do this all the time in the real world. Wikipedia is your friend.</li>
  <li>Read about general approaches to solving specific problems (e.g. a guide to
dynamic programming or a tutorial on unit testing in your programming
language), or</li>
  <li>Clarify material from the course notes or assignments.</li>
</ul>

<p>But external sources must be used to <strong>support</strong> your solution, not to
<strong>obtain</strong> your solution. You may <strong>not</strong> use them to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find solutions to the specific problems assigned as homework (in words or in
code)—you must independently solve the problem assigned, not translate a
solution presented online or elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Find course materials or solutions from this or similar courses from previous
years, or</li>
  <li>Copy text or code to use in your submissions without attribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use code from online or other sources, you must include code comments
identifying the source. It must be clear what code you wrote and what code is
from other sources. This rule also applies to text, images, and any other
material you submit.</p>

<p>Please talk to me if you have any questions about this policy. Any form of
plagiarism or cheating will result in sanctions to be determined by me,
including grade penalties (such as negative points for the assignment or
reductions in letter grade) or course failure. I am obliged to report violations
to the appropriate University authorities. See also the text below.</p>

<h4 id="mini-quizzes">Mini quizzes</h4>

<p>These are short Canvas multiple choice and True / False questions. There are 5
quizzes, one to go with each Assignment. They’re really “part of the
assignment”: you do them on your own and submit by the accompanying assignment
deadline. They’re just on Canvas to make grading easier for the TAs. Just like
the Assignments, only 4 will count, but because they’re on Canvas, your lowest
score will get dropped. You can complete it anytime by the deadline (I’ll try to
make sure that they open at the start of the module), but you only get <strong>one</strong>
chance.</p>

<h4 id="groupindividual-project">Group/individual project</h4>

<p>There will be a project. You may choose to complete it in a group of your
choosing or individually. The group can contain at most 4 individuals. The group
project has two intermediate checkpoints (see <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a>).</p>

<p>Similar policies on plagiarism as for the homework apply.</p>

<p>More details are available on the project page.</p>

<h3 id="important-considerations">Important considerations</h3>

<h4 id="covid-safety-in-the-classroom">Covid Safety in the Classroom</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Masks</dt>
  <dd>Masks are <strong>required</strong> for all indoor classes, as per the BC Public Health
Officer orders. For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that
all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while
sharing an indoor space. For the purposes of this order, the term “masks”
refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths. Masks
are a primary tool to make it harder for Covid-19 to find a new host. You will
need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class
meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else
in the class. You may be asked to remove your mask briefly for an ID check for
an exam, but otherwise, your mask should cover your nose and mouth. <strong>Please
do not eat in class. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep
your mask on between sips.</strong> Please note that there are some people who cannot
wear a mask. These individuals are equally welcome in our class.</dd>
  <dt>Vaccination</dt>
  <dd>If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19, vaccines
are available to you, free, and on campus. See
<a href="http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine">http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine</a> for help finding an appointment.
The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the
chance of spreading this virus. You are an important part of the UBC
community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.</dd>
  <dt>Seating in class</dt>
  <dd>To reduce the risk of Covid transmission, please sit in a consistent area of
the classroom each day. This will minimize your contacts and will still allow
for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="your-personal-health">Your personal health</h4>

<p><strong>If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think
you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>A daily self-health assessment is <strong>required</strong>* before attending campus. Every
day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms
using this tool: https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en</li>
  <li>Do not come to class if you have Covid symptoms, have recently tested positive
for Covid, or are required to quarantine. You can check this website to find
out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor:
http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who.</li>
  <li>Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. In this class,
the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can
prioritize your health and still be able to succeed. All work can be completed
outside of class with reasonable time allowances.</li>
  <li><strong>If you do miss class because of illness:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a connection early in the term to another student or a group of
students in the class. You can help each other by sharing notes. If you
don’t yet know anyone in the class, post on the discussion forum to
connect with other students.</li>
      <li>Consult the class resources on Canvas. We will post all the slides,
readings, and recordings for each class day.</li>
      <li>Use Slack  for help.</li>
      <li>Come to virtual office hours.</li>
      <li>See the marking scheme for reassurance about what flexibility you have.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If you are sick on a final exam day, do not attend the exam.</strong> You must
apply for deferred standing (an academic concession) through Science Advising
no later than 48 hours after the missed final exam/assignment. Students who
are granted deferred standing write the final exam/assignment at a later date.
Learn more and find the application online:
https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/concession</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please talk with me if you have any concerns or ask me if you are worried
about falling behind.</strong></p>

<h4 id="university-policies">University policies</h4>

<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy
lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are
additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic
community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of
academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with
disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values
academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by
others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.
Details of the policies and how to access support are available
<a href="http://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="academic-honesty-and-standards">Academic honesty and standards</h4>

<p><strong>UBC Vancouver Statement</strong></p>

<p>Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of
British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC
students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic
community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate
policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to
academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.</p>

<p>For the full statement, please see the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0#15620">2020/21 Vancouver Academic
Calendar</a></p>

<p><strong>Course specific</strong></p>

<p>Several commercial services have approached students regarding selling class
notes/study guides to their classmates. Please be advised that selling a faculty
member’s notes/study guides individually or on behalf of one of these services
using UBC email or Canvas, violates both UBC information technology and UBC
intellectual property policy. Selling the faculty member’s notes/study guides to
fellow students in this course is not permitted. Violations of this policy will
be considered violations of UBC Academic Honesty and Standards and will be
reported to the Dean of Science as a violation of course rules. Sanctions for
academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment for which the
notes/study guides are being sold, a reduction in your final course grade, a
failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. Similarly, contracting
with any service that results in an individual other than the enrolled student
providing assistance on quizzes or exams or posing as an enrolled student is
considered a violation of UBC’s academic honesty standards.</p>

<p>Some of the problems that are assigned are similar or identical to those
assigned in previous years by me or other instructors for this or other courses.
Using proofs or code from anywhere other than the textbooks (with attribution),
this year’s course notes (with attribution), or the course website is not only
considered cheating (as described above), it is easily detectable cheating. Such
behavior is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>In previous years, I have caught students cheating on the exams. I did not
enforce any penalty because the action did not help. Cheating, in my experience,
occurs because students don’t understand the material, so the result is usually
a failing grade even before I impose any penalty and report the incident to the
Dean’s office. I carefully structure exams to make it so that I can catch these
issues. I <strong>will</strong> catch you, and it does not help. Do your own work, and use
the TA and me as resources. If you are struggling, we are here to help.</p>

<p><em>If I suspect cheating, your case will be forwarded to the Dean’s office. No questions asked.</em></p>

<h4 id="academic-concessions">Academic Concessions</h4>

<p>These are handled according to UBC policy. Please see</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions">UBC student services</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,0,0,0">UBC Vancouver Academic Calendar</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/concession">Faculty of Science Concessions</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="missed-final-exam">Missed final exam</h4>

<p>Students who miss the final exam must report to their Faculty advising office
within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation.
Only your Faculty Advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You
must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the
exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your
deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied
for and received deferred standing from their Faculty.</p>

<h4 id="censorship">Censorship</h4>

<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching
and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep
in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered
illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to,
human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or
sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a
student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local
jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course
material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to
academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit
<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0">this link</a> for
an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement
on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate
reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns
regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with
manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic
advisor to find substitute courses. For further information and support, please
visit <a href="http://academic.ubc.ca/support-resources/freedom-expression">this link</a>.</p>

<h4 id="take-care-of-yourself">Take care of yourself</h4>

<p>Course work at this level can be intense, and I encourage you to take care of
yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking
some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
I struggle with these issues too, and I try hard to set aside time for things
that make me happy (cooking, playing/listening to music, exercise, going for
walks).</p>

<p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. If you are having any
problems or concerns, do not hesitate to speak with me. There are also many
resources available on campus that can provide help and support. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is almost always a good idea.</p>

      <p>A careful reading of the linked paper with the provocative title “Law
of Urination: all mammals empty their bladders over the same duration”

their claim is more accurately stated as “mammals over 3kg in body weight
urinate in 21 seconds with a standard deviation of 13 seconds”. But the
accurate charactization is far less publicity-worthy. <a href="#fnref:note" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
