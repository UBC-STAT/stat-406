Commit with the message “on the wrong branch” and push.\nYou likely see an error like:\nremote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.\nThat’s because you’re on main. Ugh! But I did some work, and now I need to be on a different branch!\nSo let’s fix it. We want the stuff we just did on main to be on lab00-git. Note that everything you did is saved! Here are the steps:\nGet our changes onto the correct branch\n\nUse the dropdown to switch branches to lab00-git.\nGo to the Terminal (next to console).\nType git merge main.\n\nThat should copy all your changes in the .Rmd that you made on main into the correct place. Did it?\nIf you do this and you ever see stuff like\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nThis is the stuff that is currently on this branch.\n=======\nThis is stuff that got added on the other branch.\nWhile someone else changed stuff on this branch!\nI (git) don't know which to keep!?\nYou have to decide for me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new_branch_for_merge_conflict\nThis means that there were conflicts between the two versions. The stuff above ====== was in your current branch. The stuff below is what you’re trying to merge in. You decide what to keep, the top, the bottom, or both (or neither). Just be sure to delete the junk lines with &lt;, &gt;, or =.\nOnce you’ve resolved conflicts (and committed the conflict changes), double check the following:\n\nYou are on the correct branch (lab00-git)\nYou have no files with uncommitted changes in the “Git” tab\nYour changes to the R chunk above exist (on this branch)\n\nAnother way you can check for your changes is by running the git log commmand. You should see something like the following:\ncommit 1efefd8473c2cc81893dd2a5ded929978d9ee2aa (HEAD -&gt; lab00-git, main)\nAuthor: Geoff Pleiss &lt;824157+gpleiss@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 30 16:41:58 2024 -0700\n\n    on the wrong branch\n\ncommit 328436d60d8153db7f5b8caef56919b69a5448a2 (origin/main)\nAuthor: Geoff Pleiss &lt;824157+gpleiss@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 30 4:44:09 2024 -0700\n\n    Update git instructions\n\ncommit bb21d0cc444e65be9d801c6b672ba7491509f030\nAuthor: Geoff Pleiss &lt;824157+gpleiss@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 30 10:59:12 2024 -0700\n\n    Init\nThere’s a lot of information here, but you should (hopefully) see at the top your latest commit with the message “on the wrong branch.” The long string at the start of the commit (1efefd8473c2cc81893dd2a5ded929978d9ee2aa) is the hash. It is a unique identifier of the commit, which can be useful if you want to reference a specific commit with other commands.\nType q to exit the log viewer.\n\nOk. So now we have our changes in the right spot. Commit and Push the .Rmd (only). Let’s clean up main so we don’t have problems later. Switch back to main.\nUndo mistakes on the wrong branch.\nIn the terminal, type the following two commands:\ngit fetch\ngit reset --hard origin/main\nThere’s a lot to unpack in these two commands, but here’s the high level idea: we want to make sure that our main branch matches what’s on Github’s remote main branch. The second command resets our local main branch so that it has exactly the same commits as Github’s remote main branch. (The first command makes sure that our local computer knows about the latest changes on Github’s remote branches.)\nIf you now type git log, you should now see\ncommit 328436d60d8153db7f5b8caef56919b69a5448a2 (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main)\nAuthor: Geoff Pleiss &lt;824157+gpleiss@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 30 4:44:09 2024 -0700\n\n    Update git instructions\n\ncommit bb21d0cc444e65be9d801c6b672ba7491509f030\nAuthor: Geoff Pleiss &lt;824157+gpleiss@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 30 10:59:12 2024 -0700\n\n    Init\nSo our local main branch matches what’s on Github, and no longer contains the “on the wrong branch” commit. You can also verify that your changes to the R code on this branch are now gone.\nTo recap, now the work we want is in the right place (on the other branch), and the mess on main is cleaned up. Boom."

    "text": "Scenario 2. You did something you shouldn’t have\nSwitch your branch back to lab00-git (or whatever you named it).\nOpen the file lab01.Rmd. Select everything after # Instructions and delete it. Save. Then Knit (producing a pdf). Commit both files with a message “did the wrong lab, and built a pdf”. Push your commits with the Green up arrow.\nTake a look at the PR on Github now. There’s a bunch of crud that shouldn’t be there.\nWe’ve done 3 things here that we shouldn’t have.\n\nWe built a pdf that we don’t want at all. It needs to go away.\nWe bollixed up the lab01.Rmd file. We don’t want that or it will screw up the lab next week.\nWe pushed it all into our submission for this week.\n\nThe first instinct is to Delete both files, commit, and push. This is VERY BAD. That will further screw up everything. Basically, you’re telling git “I don’t want these files at all” when you mean “I don’t want changes to these files in this branch”. The difference is subtle but important. Because you DO want these files (without the changes) at some point, but you don’t want them here.\nLet’s fix these issues.\n\nFirst, we want to “get rid of” the pdf. In the Terminal type\ngit reset HEAD^ -- lab01.pdf\nClick the little “Refresh” arrow in the Git panel. You should now see lab01.pdf twice, once with a red D that is checked and once with two yellow question marks that is NOT checked. This is what we want.\nCommit exactly as is. Use a message like “remove the stray pdf” and Push. Now, take a look at the PR on Github. It should be gone from the list of files in the PR.\nThere’s still that annoying two-yellow-question-mark version in the Git panel. Don’t click the check box (that will just redo everything we undid). Instead, highlight the file by clicking the file name, click the Gear Icon Dropdown, and then select “Revert”. Now it’s gone, and the pdf should disappear from your filesystem.\n\nSecond, let’s “undo” the deletion in the .Rmd. This is easy, and a useful pattern to remember.\nIn the Terminal, type\ngit checkout main -- lab01.Rmd\nWhat this does is grabs the version on main that isn’t messed up and puts it here, overwriting your changes. This isn’t the only way to fix your problem (you could have done the same thing we did with the pdf), but it’s pretty easy.\nStage commit and push. Now look at the PR on Github. Even though you made two changes (one deleting everything, and one restoring everything) to the lab01.Rmd, it should be “gone” from the PR now. That’s because the version on this branch looks just like the version on main, so there are no changes to be made into the main branch. This is just what we want.\n\nNow we’ve also fixed the third error already. None of those bogus changes to lab01 are in our PR for this week anymore."

    "text": "Warmup Decomposition (Estimation versus Prediction Error)\n\nTo decompose risk into multiple meaningful terms, we are going to play a mathematician’s favorite trick: adding zero.\nMore specifically, we are going to add and subtract a very specific quantity, the expected label \\(\\bar{Y}(X)\\), within the square loss portion of risk:\n\\[ \\mathcal R = \\mathbb E\\left[ (Y - f_\\mathcal{D}(X))^2 \\right] = \\mathbb E\\left[ \\left( Y \\overbrace{- \\bar{Y}(X) + \\bar{Y}(X)}^{= 0} - f_\\mathcal{D}(X) \\right)^2 \\right] \\]\nSo far, this is dumb.

After simplifying…\n\n\n(see steps here)\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathcal R &= \\mathbb E\\left[ A^2 + B^2 + 2AB \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\mathbb E\\left[ A^2 \\right] + \\mathbb E\\left[ B^2 \\right] + 2\\mathbb E\\left[ AB \\right]\n    \\end{align*}\\]\nConsider \\(\\mathbb E\\left[ AB \\right] = \\mathbb E\\left[ (Y - \\bar{Y}(X))(\\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X)) \\right]\\). Applying the tower property, we have that:\n\\[ \\mathbb E\\left[ AB \\right] = \\mathbb E\\left[ \\mathbb E\\left[ (Y - \\bar{Y}(X))(\\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X)) \\mid X, \\mathcal D \\right] \\right]. \\]\nWithin the inner expectation, \\(Y\\) is the only random term after conditioning on \\(\\mathcal D\\) and \\(X\\). Since \\(Y\\) is independent of our training data, we have that \\(\\mathbb E[ Y \\mid X, \\mathcal D ] = \\mathbb E[ Y \\mid X ] = \\bar{Y}(X)\\). Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n      \\mathbb E\\left[ AB \\right]\n      &= \\mathbb E\\left[ \\mathbb E\\left[ (Y - \\bar{Y}(X))(\\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X)) \\mid X, \\mathcal D \\right] \\right] \\\\\n      &= \\mathbb E\\left[ \\left( \\mathbb E[ Y \\mid X, \\mathcal D] - \\bar{Y}(X) \\right) \\left( \\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X) \\right) \\right] \\\\\n      &= \\mathbb E\\left[ (\\bar{Y}(X) - \\bar{Y}(X)) \\left( \\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X) \\right) \\right] = 0.\n    \\end{align*}\\]\nThus, the cross term vanishes, and we are left with\n\\[ \\mathcal R = \\mathbb E\\left[ A^2 \\right] + \\mathbb E\\left[ B^2 \\right].\\]\nPlugging back in the definitions of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)…\n\n… we get that\n\\[ \\mathcal R = \\underbrace{\\mathbb E\\left[ \\left( Y - \\bar{Y}(X) \\right)^2 \\right]}_\\text{irreducible error} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb E\\left[ \\left( \\bar{Y}(X) - f_\\mathcal{D}(X) \\right)^2 \\right]}_\\text{estimation error} \\]\n\n\nEstimation versus Irreducible Error\nI claim these two terms have intuitive interpretations:\n\nThe first term, the irreducible error, quantifies the inherent uncertainty in the response variable. Even if we were to perfectly know the conditional distribution \\(P(Y \\mid X)\\), we would not be able to perfectly predict \\(Y\\) from \\(X\\) due to some inherent randomness in \\(Y \\mid X\\).\nThe second term, the estimation error, quantifies how far off our learned model \\(f_\\mathcal{D}\\) is from the optimal prediction rule \\(\\bar{Y}(X)\\). It quantifies how well our learned model approximates the regression function; i.e. the optimal prediction rule.\n\nThe irreducible error is independent of our model/learning procedure. In general, we have no control over this term; it’s always there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCaveat\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, we can reduce the “irreducible” error by expanding our set of covariates \\(X\\).\nConsider, for example, if we are trying to predict the temperature outside \\(Y\\) given the time of day \\(X\\). If we were to add the additional covariate of the day of the year \\(X'\\), then \\(E[Y \\mid X, X']\\) would be a better predictor of \\(Y\\) than \\(E[Y \\mid X]\\) alone.\n\n\n\nThe estimation error is the term we control with our model/estimation/prediction procedures. It will always be non-negative because we can only estimate \\(\\bar Y(X)\\) so well from limited data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI also claim that this decomposition proves my earlier statement that the regression function \\(\\bar{Y}(X)\\) is the optimal prediction rule.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nThe first term, the prediction error, does not depend on our model \\(f_\\mathcal{D}\\) at all. It is a property of the data distribution \\(P(X, Y)\\), and it is non-negative.\nThe second term, the estimation error, is non-negative because it is an expectation of a squared term. It will be minimized when it equals zero, which happens when \\(f_\\mathcal{D}(X) = \\bar{Y}(X)\\) for all \\(X\\)."

High variance is bad, because it means that our predictions depend more on a particular training sample rather than generalizable patterns in the data.\nBias: captures how much “generalizable truth” can actually be learned by our statistical model/estimation procedure. High bias implies that, even if we had access to many training samples to “average out” the noise, we would still only be able to learn a poor approximation of the regression function \\(\\bar{Y}(X)\\).\n\n\n\nCartoon illustration of bias and variance. (Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)\n\n\n\nBoth bias and variance contribute to the risk/test error of our learned model.\nAs you might imagine, these two terms are often in tension with one another.\nFor example, a very simple model (e.g. linear regression with few features) will have high bias (it can’t capture complex patterns in the data), but low variance (it won’t change much if we retrain it on a different dataset).\nConversely, a very complex model (e.g. linear regression with millions of features) will have low bias (it can capture complex patterns in the data), but high variance (it will change a lot if we retrain it on a different dataset).\nBoth settings lead to high risk, but for different reasons.\nOptimizing risk requires balancing these two sources of error (e.g. finding the optimal number of features for the linear regression).\n\n\n\n\nBias and variance are at odds with one another. Effect of # of variables on bias/variance. (Figure derived from http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)\n\n\n\nWe will discuss other factors that affect bias and variance in future lectures (e.g. regularization, basis functions, etc.).\n\n\n\nDetecting High Bias and High Variance\nIf we want to make a modeling/estimation/prediction change to reduce risk, it’s important to know the source of the problem: is it high bias or high variance?

Similarly, \\(P(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_A \\mathbf{1}_B]\\) and \\(P(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(\\overline{A} \\cap \\overline{B})\\).\n\n\n\nConditional Expectations and The Tower Rule\n\nThe conditional expectation of \\(A\\) given \\(B=b\\) is defined as:\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[A \\mid B = b] := \\int_{a} a \\: P(A=a \\mid B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}a. \\]\nIt is the average value that \\(A\\) takes when we have the additional information that the random variable \\(B\\) takes on the value \\(b\\).\nNote that this conditional expectation is a function of \\(b\\); i.e. we can write\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[A \\mid B = b] = g(b) \\qquad \\text{for some function} g.\\]\nThe expression \\(\\mathbb{E} [A \\mid B]\\) should then be read as:\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[A \\mid B] = g(B). \\]\nI.e. that we are applying the conditional expectation function to the random variable \\(B\\) rather than to a specific realization \\(b\\).\nTo relate \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B]\\) to \\(\\mathbb E[A]\\), we can use the sum and product rules to get:\n\\[ \\mathbb E[A] = \\mathbb E[ \\mathbb E[ A \\mid B]] \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDerivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\mathbb{E}[A] &= \\int_a a \\int_b P(A=a, B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}b \\: \\mathrm{d}a\n  \\\\\n  &= \\int_a a \\int_b P(A=a \\mid B=b) P(B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}b \\: \\mathrm{d}a\n  \\\\\n  &= \\int_b \\left( \\int_a a P(A=a \\mid B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}a \\right) P(B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}b\n  \\\\\n  &= \\int_b \\mathbb{E}[A \\mid B=b] P(B=b) \\: \\mathrm{d}b\n  \\\\\n  &= \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\mathbb{E}[ A \\mid B ] \\right]\n  \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nThis rule is known as the Tower Rule. It allows us to express marginal expectations as recursive applications of conditional expectations.\nThis notation is often confusing and scary the first few times you encounter it. Try translating it back into probabilities via the sum and product rules, and you’ll fluently understand it in no time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantImportant: What is Random?\n\n\n\n\nA (standard) expectation \\(\\mathbb E[A]\\) is not a random variable (despite the fact that there’s a random variable inside the expectation).\n\n\nWhy?\n\nIf we go back to the definition: $ E[A] = a P(A=a) da $, note that the two terms in the integral \\(a\\), \\(P(A=a)\\) are functions of \\(a\\), which is a realized quantity and therefore not random. So we’re integrating non-random quantities together, giving us a non-random output.\n\nThe conditional expectation \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B=b]\\) is also not a random variable.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nAgain going back to the definition: $ E[A B=b] = a P(A=a B=b) da$, the terms inside the integral are functions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (realized quantities, not random variables).\n\nHowever, the conditional expectation \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B]\\) is a random variable.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nRecall that we can view \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B=b]\\) as some function of \\(b\\); i.e. \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B=b] = g(b)\\). When we plug a realization (i.e. not a random variable) into \\(g\\), the output is a fixed (not random) quantity.\nHowever, when we plug in a random variable into \\(g\\), the output is a random quantity! So \\(\\mathbb E[A \\mid B] = g(B)\\) is a random variable due to the randomness in \\(B\\)."

Beginning with linear models and building beyond STAT 306 content, we will progress to an in-depth coverage of classic and modern learning methods with greater mathematical and statistical depth than CPSC 340.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nThe primary aim of this course is to develop deep statistical intuitions about different learning methods and the connections between these methods. If we are successful, by the end of the course you will be able to:\n\nFormulate and analyze machine learning algorithms from a statistical perspective\nCategorize learning methods through multiple criteria (supervised versus unsupervised, linear versus nonlinear, parametric versus nonparametric, high bias versus high variance)\nDraw connections between any two learning algorithms and paradigms covered in this course\nReason about which methods (regularization, nonlinearities, ensembles) are most appropriate for a given situation using mathematical tools like the bias/variance tradeoff and curse of dimensionality\nApply these methods correctly, troubleshoot common pitfalls, and identify probable steps for improving model performance\nImplement and utilize models in R using best coding practices\n\n\nWhat This Course Is Not\nThis course is not a practitioner’s introduction to machine learning. While you will gain practical skills in the course and you will be equipped to run and troubleshoot models, the emphasis is not on the latest and greatest models, software packages, using high performance compute infrastructure, or data wrangling. There is no project component where you get to build a model of your choice on your own dataset. If this is the content you are looking for, I suggest CPSC 330 or any number of tutorials that exist on the internet.\nThis course is also not a comprehensive introduction to all of the latest and greatest ML methods. Methods evolve constantly, and there are too many of them to introduce in one course. I suggest advanced topics courses in computer science or statistics if you want a flavour of new methods. The foundational methods introduced in this course are building blocks used by all machine learning algorithms. Mastering these concepts will dramatically improve your ability to understand new methods, and it will also help you cut through the BS components of modern ML/AI systems that don’t actually do anything too fancy.\nBuilding fluency with tools and processes is an important part of becoming a statistician or machine learning practitioner, as is being up to date with methods. It is equally important to be able to analyze and reason about the methods and tools that you’re using. The latter is the niche filled by this course."

    "text": "Lectures\nThis will be taught primarily via lecture, with interactive activities, questions, and discussions interspersed throughout. Attendance is strongly encouraged.\nDeveloping intuitions for this material takes time and effort, and the lectures provide an excellent setting and opportunity for you to ponder, struggle, and engage with the material.\nWhen you attend lecture, I ask that you minimize the use of phones and computers other than for participation and note taking. I know that it is easy to be distracted by homework, social media, or k-pop videos.[^The lecture recordings capture the audience, so I get to see the fun things you’re looking at on your laptops!]\nIf you aren’t able to provide your full attention during class, especially during the participatory activities, I kindly ask that you stay home instead. Your grade won’t suffer (I don’t track attendance) and your health and academic performance will benefit from the extra sleep.\nHere are the benefits for being participatory during lecture:\n\nYou’ll put in the work to develop deep intuitions. We’ll work through derivations during lecture that you won’t see on labs or assignments. Participating in these derivations gives you a different mode for absorbing the material.\nYou get to ask questions. This material is my bread and butter, it’s my area of research, and I have lots of insights that I’m excited to share! I’ll also answer questions over slack and during office hours, but your best bet to get good answers from me is during class.\nYou’ll get participation points. See below for a way to boost your grade by participating during lecture.\nYou’ll get a better letter of recommendation. If you want to apply to graduate school and would consider me for a letter of recommendation, I should know something about you beyond your letter grade. Asking and answering questions during lecture and office hours gives me good material to write about."

    "section": "Course Assessment Opportunities",
    "text": "Course Assessment Opportunities\n\nEffort-Based Component\nThe effort-based assessments are your main tools to develop the deep intuitions about ML that we’re trying to achieve in this course. They will ask you to implement and troubleshoot models, wrestle with complex mathematical ideas, and ponder strange phenomena. Think of these assessments like eating your vegetables, doing a workout, or practicing an instrument. The work is hard, but it builds a deeper understanding about statistics and ML methods that you can’t get through other means—helping you learn to formulate algorithms from a statistical perspective, connect different learning methods, and figure out which approaches work best in different situations.\n\n\n\nComponent\nPossible Points\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\n5\n\n\nClickers\n10\n\n\nLabs\n20\n\n\nHomeworks\n40\n\n\nTotal\nmin(60, Participation + Clickers + Labs + Homeworks)\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI Policy\nChatbots and agentic tools are quite adept with the content that we’ll cover. I used them to help me develop materials for this course (mostly to flesh out/polish ideas rather than to generate content from scratch). I believe they have the potential to aid in your learning, but also the potential to be a tempting shortcut that inhibits your potential to grow from this course.\nTo get the most out of this course, I strongly recommend using generative AI as little as possible. If you feel the need to use it, use it to supplement and strengthen your thinking (e.g. code completion, rewriting bullet points into paragraphs, etc.) rather than to replace your thinking (e.g. feeding the entire assignment into a chatbot or agentic coding tool). Here’s why:\n\nThe goal of this course is developing deep intuitions about challenging material. Developing intuitions requires thinking, meditating, and struggling with content.\nAnyone can use Claude Code, Copilot, or Cursor to develop simple ML models and pipelines. If you want to stand out as a job or graduate student candidate, you need to demonstrate the ability to think beyond what these tools can do.\nThere are enough questions with course-specific subtleties where a chatbot will produce a subpar or wrong answer. Even with really good prompting, you likely won’t score above a 7 or 8 on assignments (which is the median effort grade anyways).\nYou won’t be able to use any AI tools during the midterm or final. There likely won’t be any coding questions, but you don’t want to be too dependent on these tools when it comes to proving your knowledge.\n\nIf you use any generative AI tool on homeworks or labs, I ask that you self report how you used the tools and how they contributed to your learning/ability to understand the assignment. (There will be a box to fill in at the top of every lab and assignment.) Include every prompt that you used. Please be as honest as possible, even if you did just get ChatGPT to answer every question for you. Your responses will help me structure the material better especially as these tools evolve.\n\n\n\nParticipation\nI believe that active participation during lecture is the best way to learn the material. To that end, I’ve crafted lectures to be entertaining (especially for 8am!), interactive, and engaging for all learning styles. You can help me (and yourself!) by asking questions, working through course exercises with your neighbours, and sharing insights.\nYou earn participation points by answering questions or contributing to discussions. I’ll use the Agora platform to monitor hand raises and select students. Every time you raise your hand in the Agora app, you earn 1 point. When you’re randomly called on from raised hands, you also gain a point. Your final participation score is calculated as min(5, 5 * num_points / num_classes_with_agora). In essence, if you raise your hand at least once every class, you’ll receive the maximum participation grade.\nNote on attendance. I will not be tracking attendance, so you do not need to alert me if you need to skip the occasional lecture. You can still get a perfect effort-based grade even if you do not participate (though I sincerely hope you choose to do so!)\n\n\n\nClickers\nThroughout lecture, I will ask short multiple choice and True/False questions, which you will answer using the iClicker app. For each question, correct answers are worth 4, incorrect answers are worth 2. You get 0 points for not answering.\nSuppose there are N total clicker questions, and you have x points. Your final score for the clicker component is max(0, min(5 * x / N - 5, 10)).\nNote that if your average is less than 1, you get 0 points in this component.\n\n\n\nLabs\nThese are intended to keep you on track. They are to be submitted via pull requests in your personal labs-&lt;username&gt; repo (see the computing tab for descriptions on how to do this).\nLabs typically have a few questions for you to answer or code to implement. These are designed to be done during lab periods, but you can do them on your own as well. These are worth 2 points each up to a maximum of 20 points. They are due at 2300 on the day of your assigned lab section.\nIf you attend lab, you may share a submission with another student (with acknowledgement on the PR). If you do not attend lab, you must work on your own (subject to the collaboration instructions for Assignments below).\n\nRules.\nYou must submit via PR by the deadline. Your PR must include at least 3 commits. After lab 2, failure to include at least 3 commits will result in a maximum score of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you attend your lab section, you may work in pairs, submitting a single document to one of your Repos. Be sure to put both names on the document, and mention the collaboration on your PR. You still have until 11pm to submit.\n\n\n\n\nMarking.\nThe overriding theme here is “if you put in the effort, you’ll get all the points.” Grading scheme:\n\n2 if basically all correct\n1 if complete but with some major errors, or mostly complete and mostly correct\n0 otherwise\n\nYou may submit as many labs as you wish up to 20 total points. There are no appeals on grades.\n\n\n\n\nHomeworks\nThere will be 4 homework assignments. These are submitted via pull request similar to the labs but to the homework-&lt;username&gt; repo. Each assignment is worth up to 10 points. They are due by 2300 on the deadline. You must make at least 5 commits. Failure to have at least 5 commits will result in a 25% deduction on HW1 and a 50% deduction thereafter. No exceptions.\nAssignments are typically lightly marked. The median last year was 8/10. But they are not easy. Nor are they short. They often involve a combination of coding, writing, description, and production of statistical graphics.\nAfter receiving a mark and feedback, if you score less than 7, you may make corrections to bring your total to 7. This means, if you fix everything that you did wrong, you get 7. Not 10. The revision must be submitted within 1 week of getting your mark. Only 1 revision per assignment. The TA decision is final. Note that the TAs will only regrade parts you missed, but if you somehow make it worse, they can deduct more points.\nThe revision allowance applies only if you got 3 or more points of “content” deductions. If you missed 3 points for content and 2 more for “penalties” (like insufficient commits, code that runs off the side of the page, etc), then you are ineligible.\n\nPolicy on collaboration on assignments\nDiscussing assignments with your classmates is allowed and encouraged, but it is important that every student get practice working on these problems. This means that all the work you turn in must be your own. The general policy on homework collaboration is:\n\nYou must first make a serious effort to solve the problem.\nIf you are stuck after doing so, you may ask for help from another student. You may discuss strategies to solve the problem, but you may not look at their code, nor may they spell out the solution to you step-by-step.\nOnce you have gotten help, you must write your own solution individually. You must disclose, in your GitHub pull request, the names of anyone from whom you got help.\nThis also applies in reverse: if someone approaches you for help, you must not provide it unless they have already attempted to solve the problem, and you may not share your code or spell out the solution step-by-step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAdherence to the above policy means that identical answers, or nearly identical answers, cannot occur. Thus, such occurrences are violations of the Course’s Academic honesty policy.\n\n\nYou can always, of course, ask me for help on Slack. And public Slack questions are allowed and encouraged.\nYou may also use external sources (books, websites, papers, …) to\n\nLook up programming language documentation, find useful packages, find explanations for error messages, or remind yourself about the syntax for some feature. I do this all the time in the real world. Wikipedia is your friend.\nRead about general approaches to solving specific problems (e.g. a guide to dynamic programming or a tutorial on unit testing in your programming language), or\nClarify material from the course notes or assignments.\n\nIf you use code from online or other sources (including generative AI), you must include code comments identifying the source. It must be clear what code you wrote and what code is from other sources. This rule also applies to text, images, and any other material you submit.\nPlease talk to me if you have any questions about this policy. Any form of plagiarism or cheating will result in sanctions to be determined by me, including grade penalties (such as negative points for the assignment or reductions in letter grade) or course failure. I am obliged to report violations to the appropriate University authorities. See also the text below.\n\n\n\n\nYour score on HW, Labs, and Clickers\nThe total you can accumulate across these 3 components is 60 points. But you can get there however you want. The total available is 75 points. The rest is up to you. But with choice, comes responsibility.\nRules:\n\nNothing dropped.\nNo extensions.\nIf you miss a lab or a homework deadline, then you miss it.\nMake up for missed work somewhere else.\nIf you get sick, fine. You miss a few clickers and maybe a lab (though you can do it remotely).\nIf you have a job interview and can’t complete an assignment on time, then skip it.\n\nI’m not going to police this stuff. You don’t need to let me know if you miss an assignment. There is no reason that every single person enrolled in this course shouldn’t get &gt; 65 in this class.\nIllustrative scenarios:\n\nDoing 80% on 4 homeworks (32 points), getting 5 clicker points, completing 9 labs with perfect scores, and gaining 5 participation points gets you 60 points.\nDoing 90% on 4 homeworks (36 points), getting 7 clicker points, completing 6 labs with perfect scores, and gaining 5 participation points gets you 60 points.\nGetting full homeworks (40 points) and full labs (20 points), with 0 clicker and 0 participation points gets you 60 points.\n\nChoose your own adventure. Note that the biggest barrier to getting to 60 is skipping the assignments.\n\n\n\nLate policy\nLate lab/homework submissions will not be accepted.\nMore specifically, any submission that we receive after grading has commenced will receive a 0. We likely won’t start grading at 11:01pm on the due date, so don’t worry if you’re a few minutes late. On the other hand, don’t even bother submitting if you’ve missed the deadline by a few days. This policy may seem harsh, but remember that there are many paths to a full 65 on the effort-based grade. If you miss one assignment, focus on doing well on the other labs/assignments and you might still end up with an A in the course.\n\n\n\n\nSummative Assessment\n\nMidterm Exam\n10 points, in class, on Canvas.\n\nAll multiple choice, True/False, matching.\nThe clickers are the best preparation.\nQuestions may ask you to understand or find mistakes in code.\nNo writing code.\n\n\n\nFinal Exam\n30 points, hand written.\n\nThe midterm and final are very hard. It is intended to separate those who really understand the material from those who don’t. Last year, the median grade on the final was 50%.\nYou can still end up with a very good grade even if you don’t do well on the exams. If you put in the work (do all the effort points) and the median grade on the midterm and final (50%), you’ll get an 80. If you put in the work (do all the effort points) and skip the midterm and final, you get a 60. You do not have to pass the final to pass the course. You don’t even have to take the final.\nThe point of this scheme is for those who work hard to do well. But only those who really understand the material will get 90+."

Work on developing good habits that will enable you to attend class while staying well-rested. However, it may be better to sacrifice in-person attendance than your sleep, especially if you would be so sleep-deprived that you won’t be able to benefit from class. I hope you make responsible decisions.\nYour health precautions help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. In this class, the marking scheme provides flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still succeed. All work can be completed outside of class with reasonable time allowances.\nIf you do miss class because of illness:\n\nMake connections early in the term with other students in the class. You can help each other by sharing notes. If you don’t yet know anyone in the class, post on the discussion forum to connect with other students.\nConsult the class resources here and on Canvas. We will post all slides, readings, and recordings for each class.\nUse Slack for help.\nCome to virtual office hours.\nSee the marking scheme for reassurance about your flexibility options. No part of your final grade will be directly impacted by missing class.\n\nIf you are sick on midterm day or final exam day, do not attend the exam. You must follow up with your home faculty’s advising office to apply for deferred standing. Students who are granted deferred standing write the final exam at a later date. If you’re a Science student, you must apply for deferred standing (an academic concession) through Science Advising no later than 48 hours after the missed final exam/assignment. Learn more and find the application online. For additional information about academic concessions, see the UBC policy here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease talk with me if you have any concerns or ask me if you are worried about falling behind."

Only your Faculty Advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their Faculty.\n\n\nTake care of yourself\nCourse work at this level can be intense, and I encourage you to take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. I struggle with these issues too, and I try hard to set aside time for things that make me happy (cooking, playing/listening to music, exercise, going for walks).\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. If you are having any problems or concerns, do not hesitate to speak with me. There are also many resources available on campus that can provide help and support. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always a good idea.\nIf you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. UBC Science has resources on their website. UBC Counseling Services is here to help: call 604 822 3811 or visit their website. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty member, or family member you trust to help get you the support you need."

    "text": "Common Git and Workflow Issues\n\nmaster/main\n“master” has some pretty painful connotations. So as part of an effort to remove racist names from code, the default branch is now “main” on new versions of GitHub. But old versions (like the UBC version) still have “master”. Below, I’ll use “main”, but if you see “master” on what you’re doing, that’s the one to use.\n\n\nStart from main\nBranches should be created from the main branch, not the one you used for the last assignment.\ngit checkout main\nThis switches to main. Then pull and start the new assignment following the workflow above. (In Rstudio, use the dropdown menu.)\n\n\nYou forgot to work on a new branch\nUgh, you did some labs before realizing you forgot to create a new branch. Don’t stress. There are some things below to try. But if you’re confused ASK. We’ve had practice with this, and soon you will too!\n(1) If you started from main and haven’t made any commits (but you SAVED!!):\ngit branch -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\nThis keeps everything you have and puts you on a new branch. No problem. Commit and proceed as usual.\n(2) If you are on main and made some commits:\ngit branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\ngit log\nThe first line makes a new branch with all the stuff you’ve done. Then we look at the log. Locate the most recent commit before you started working. It’s a long string like ac2a8365ce0fa220c11e658c98212020fa2ba7d1. Then,\ngit reset ac2a8 --hard\nThis rolls main back to that commit. You don’t need the whole string, just the first few characters. Finally\ngit checkout &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\nand continue working.\n(3) If you started work on &lt;some-old-branch&gt; for work you already submitted: This one is harder, and I would suggest getting in touch with the TAs. Here’s the procedure.\ngit commit -am \"uhoh, I need to be on a different branch\"\ngit branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\nCommit your work with a dumb message, then create a new branch. It’s got all your stuff.\ngit log\nLocate the most recent commit before you started working. It’s a long string like ac2a8365ce0fa220c11e658c98212020fa2ba7d1. Then,\ngit rebase --onto main ac2a8 &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\ngit checkout &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\nThis makes the new branch look like main but without the differences from main that are on ac2a8 and WITH all the work you did after ac2a8. It’s pretty cool. And should work. Finally, we switch to our new branch."

Briefly, we will be using the Bash shell to interact with our computers via a command line interface, Git to keep a version history of our files and upload to/download from to GitHub, and Windows Terminal to run the both Bash and Git.\nGo to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the windows version of git. After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default configuration for all pages except for the following:\n\nOn the Select Components page, add a Git Bash profile to Windows Terminal.\n\n\nTo install windows terminal visit this link and click Get to open it in Windows Store.

To make sure everything worked, close down Windows Terminal, and open it again. Git Bash should open by default, the text should be green and purple, and the tab should read MINGW64:/c/Users/$USERNAME (you should also see /c/Users/$USERNAME if you type pwd into the terminal).

To copy text from the terminal, you can highlight it with the mouse and then click Ctrl + Shift + c. To paste text you use Ctrl + Shift + v, try it by pasting the following into the terminal to check which version of Bash you just installed:\nbash --version\nThe output should look similar to this:\nGNU bash, version 4.4.23(1)-release (x86_64-pc-sys)\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;\nThis is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf there is a newline (the enter character) in the clipboard when you are pasting into the terminal, you will be asked if you are sure you want to paste since this newline will act as if you pressed enter and run the command. As a guideline you can press Paste anyway unless you are sure you don’t want this to happen.\n\n\nLet’s also check which version of git was installed:\ngit --version\ngit version 2.32.0.windows.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so make sure your if your Git is at least this version.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Git user info\nNext, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email.

    "section": "Repos",
    "text": "Repos\nThere are typically about 10 repositories. Homeworks and Labs each have 3 with very similar behaviours.\nBe careful copying directories. All of them have hidden files and folders, e.g. .git. Of particular importance are the .github directories which contain PR templates and GitHub Actions. Also relevant are the .Rprofile files which try to override Student Language settings and avoid unprintible markdown characters.\n\nHomeworks\n\nhomework-solutions\nThis is where most of the work happens. My practice is to create the homework solutions first. I edit these (before school starts) until I’m happy. I then duplicate the file and remove the answers. The result is hwxx-instructions.Rmd. The .gitignore file should ignore all of the solutions and commit only the instructions. Then, about 1 week after the deadline, I adjust the .gitignore and push the solution files.\n\nStudents have Read permission.\nTAs have Write permission.\nThe preamble.tex file is common to HWs and Labs. It creates a lavender box where the solution will go. This makes life easy for the TAs.\n\n\n\nhomework-template\nThis is a “template repo” used for creating student specific homework-studentgh repos (using the setup scripts).\nVery Important: copy the hwxx-instructions files over to a new directory. Do NOT copy the directory or you’ll end up with the solutions visible to the students.\nThen rename hwxx-instructions.Rmd to hwxx.Rmd. Now the students have a .pdf with instructions, and a template .Rmd to work on.\nOther important tasks:\n\nThe .gitignore is more elaborate in an attempt to avoid students pushing junk into these repos.\nThe .github directory contains 3 files:\n\nCODEOWNERS begins as an empty doc which will be populated with the assigned grader later;\npull_request_template.md is used for all HW submission PRs;\nworkflows contains a GH-action to comment on the PR with the date+time when the PR is opened.\n\nUnder Settings &gt; General, select “Template repository”. This makes it easier to duplicate to the student repos.\nSetup branch protection rules for the main branch. Create a new ruleset for default branches, and select the following:\n\nRequire a pull request before merging\nRequire review from Code Owners\nBlock force pushes\nI recommend adding the @TAs team to the bypass list.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabs\nThe three Labs repos operate exactly as the analogous homework repos.\n\nlabs-solutions\nDo any edits here before class begins.\n\n\nlabs-template\nSame as with the homeworks\n\n\n\nclicker-solutions\nThis contains the complete set of clicker questions.\nAnswers are hidden in comments on the presentation.\nI release them incrementally after each module (copying over from my clicker deck).\n\n\npractice-final\nContains a lengthy practice exam as well as solutions. I usually only post this during the last week of class.\n\n\nopen-pr-log\nThis contains a some GitHub actions to automatically keep track of open PRs for the TAs.\nIt’s still in testing phase, but should work properly. It will create two markdown docs, 1 for labs and 1 for homework. Each shows the assigned TA, the date the PR was opened, and a link to the PR. If everything is configured properly, it should run automatically at 3am every night.\n\nOnly the TAs should have access.\nUnder Settings &gt; Secrets and Variables &gt; Actions you must add a “Repository Secret”. This should be a GitHub Personal Access Token created in your account (Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Tokens (classic)). It needs Repo, Workflow, and Admin:Org permissions. I set it to expire at the end of the course. I use it only for this purpose (rather than my other tokens for typical logins).\n\n\n\n.github / .github-private\nThese contain README files that give some basic information about the available repos and the course.\nIt’s visible Publically, and appears on the Org homepage for all to see. The .github-private has the same function, but applies only to Org members.\n\n\nbakeoff-bakeoff\nThis is for the bonus for HW4. Both TAs and Students have access. I put the TA team as CODEOWNERS and protect the main branch (Settings &gt; Branches &gt; Branch Protection Rules). Here, we “Require approvals” and “Require Review from Code Owners”."

    "section": "What is (Supervised) Learning?",
    "text": "What is (Supervised) Learning?\nThere are many formulations of “learning” in statistics and machine learning. The main focus of this course is supervised learning.\n\nGoal of supervised learning: predict a response variable \\(Y\\) given a set of covariates \\(X\\)\n\nFor example, predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n\n\nLearning from data:\nWe are given a training dataset: \\[ \\mathcal{D} = \\{(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \\ldots, (X_n, Y_n)\\} \\in \\mathbb R^p \\times \\mathcal Y\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(X_i \\in \\mathbb R^p\\) are the \\(p\\)-dimensional covariates (e.g. size, location, number of bedrooms, etc. for each house)\n\\(Y_i \\in \\mathcal Y\\) is the response variable (e.g. house price)\n\\(\\mathcal Y\\) is the space of possible responses.\n\nFor our problem and other regression problems, \\(\\mathcal Y = \\mathbb R\\).\nFor classification problems (i.e. predicting whether the house is for sale or not) \\(\\mathcal Y\\) is a finite set of classes (e.g. “for sale” vs “not for sale”).\n\n\nFrom this training set, we want to learn a function \\(\\hat f : \\mathbb R^p \\to \\mathcal Y\\) that accurately predicts the response for new observations.\n\nGiven a set of new covariates \\(X_\\mathrm{new}\\) (e.g. a new house that we don’t know the price of)\nWe predict \\(\\hat Y_\\mathrm{new} = \\hat f(X_\\mathrm{new})\\) (e.g. our predicted price for the new house)\nOur goal is for \\(\\hat Y_\\mathrm{new} \\approx Y_\\mathrm{new}\\): the true (but unknown) price of the new house.\n\nAssumptions: what is random?\n\nUsing the notation from last lecture, you’ll note that the training data \\((X_i, Y_i)\\) and the test data \\((X_\\mathrm{new}, Y_\\mathrm{new})\\) are random variables.\nThis is a modelling choice. As statisticians, our primary tool for reasoning about the learning process is assuming something is random.\nIn particular, we’re going to make the following assumptions about our data:\n\nThere is some joint distribution \\(P(X, Y)\\) that governs the covariate/response pairs we see in the world\nOur training data are i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed) random samples from that distribution\nOur test data are also i.i.d. random samples from that distribution.\n\n\nBut isn’t our data given to us?\n\nIn the real world, your training data will actually be some set of numbers. For example, your boss may hand you a CSV with covariate/response pairs. How are these quantities random, if the data are fixed and handed to us?\nAgain, randomness is a modelling assumption that we use to simplify our lives. So how does this assumption help us?\nWhat we want to codify in our model: the data we make predictions on (our test data) are “sufficiently similar” to our training data\nHow do we codify “sufficiently similar” in a probabilistic way?\n\nOne way is to assume that they come from the same population distribution.\nTo “come from the same population distribution” means that, mathematically, we treat them as random samples from \\(P(Y, X)\\).\n\n\n\nPrediction versus Inference\nIn learning we are primarily concerned with prediction over inference.\n\nInference: The goal is making a probabilistic statement about the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\n(For example, we might want to know how much the price of a house increases for each additional bedroom.)\n\nPrediction: The goal is producing accurate \\(\\hat Y_\\mathrm{new}\\).\n\nWe don’t really care about the underlying relationship, or even about making probabilistic statements about it.\nWe just want some procedure to give us good predictions."

    "text": "The Supervised Learning Procedure: Two Perspectives\n\n\nCS/Algorithmic Perspective\nLearning is often presented as an algorithm for producing a prediction rule \\(\\hat f\\) from data \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). This algorithm consists of 6 steps, which we will examine in the context of linear regression:\n\nTrain/val/test split: Divide data into training and testing sets\n\nGiven our dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), we split it into a training set \\(\\mathcal{D}_\\mathrm{train}\\), a validation set \\(\\mathcal{D}_\\mathrm{val}\\), and a test set \\(\\mathcal{D}_\\mathrm{test}\\).\n\nHypothesis class: Select a set of candidate \\(\\hat f\\) which might make a good prediction rule.\n\nFor linear regression, the hypothesis class is linear functions of the form \\(\\hat f(x) = x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\) for some \\(\\hat \\beta\\).\n\nTraining: Define a training algorithm (a procedure to choose a \\(\\hat \\beta\\) from the training data) and apply it to \\(\\mathcal{D}_\\mathrm{train}\\).\n\nMost training algorithms involve minimizing a loss function over training data.\nFor linear models, we often choose \\(\\hat f\\) to minimize the squared error loss over training data. \\[L(Y, \\hat Y) = (Y - \\hat Y)^2, \\qquad \\hat \\beta = \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\beta} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L(Y_i, X_i^\\top \\beta). \\]\n\nValidation: Test performance on withheld validation data.\n\nWe compute the average loss on the validation set to evaluate how well our model generalizes to unseen data.\n\nIteration: Refine model based on evaluation results\n\nWe may choose to change our hypothesis class, the set of features, the loss function, or the training algorithm to try to reduce validation error.\n\nTesting (confusingly referred to by some as “Inference”): Once satisfied with the model, evaluate on the test set to estimate performance on new data.\n\n\n\nStatistical Perspective\nOver the next few lectures, we will derive the CS/algorithmic perspective from first statistical principles. For this lecture, we will focus on a statistical perspective on Steps 2, 3, and 6:\n\n\n\nStep\nCS Perspective\nStatistical Perspective\n\n\n\n\n2\nHypothesis Class\nStatistical Model\n\n\n3\nTraining\nEstimation\n\n\n6\nTesting (Inference)\nPrediction"

    "text": "Statistical Models\nA statistical model defines the possible relationships between the covariates \\(X\\) and the response variable \\(Y\\).\n\nFormally, it is a set of probability distributions that could possibly generate the data we observe.\nFor the learning problem, where we care about predicting \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), we will consider statistical models that are sets of conditional distributions \\(P(Y \\mid X)\\).\n\n\nThe Linear Regression Model\n\nFrom STAT 306, you may recall that we typically assume that the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can be described as: \\[Y = X^\\top \\beta + \\varepsilon\\]\n\n\\(\\beta\\) is the vector of parameters that we are trying to estimate.\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is the random error term, which is typically i.i.d. \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\sigma^2 &gt; 0\\).\n(You may notice that we don’t have an intercept term \\(\\beta_0\\) in this model. We assume that \\(X\\) has an “all-ones” covariate, i.e. \\(X = [1, X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p]\\), so that the intercept term \\(\\beta_0\\) is included with the other \\(\\beta\\) terms, i.e. \\(X^\\top \\beta = \\beta_0 + X_1^\\top \\beta_1 + \\ldots + X_p^\\top \\beta_p\\).)\n\nFor any given \\(\\beta\\), if we are given \\(X = x\\), then we have that \\(Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x^\\top\\beta, \\sigma^2)\\). Thus, the corresponding statistical model/set of possible conditional distributions is:\n\n\\[\\left\\{ P \\: : \\: P(Y \\mid X = x) \\: = \\: \\mathcal{N}(x^\\top\\beta, \\sigma^2), \\:\\: \\beta \\in \\mathbb R^p \\right\\}.\\]\n\nWe refer to \\(\\beta\\) as the parameters of the model, as a given value of \\(\\beta\\) specifies a particular distribution within the set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise: What is Random?\n\n\n\nGoing back to the linear model \\(Y = X^\\top \\beta + \\varepsilon,\\) which of these values are random?\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\\[ \\underbrace{Y}_\\text{random} = \\underbrace{X^\\top}_\\text{random} \\underbrace{\\beta}_\\text{fixed} + \\underbrace{\\varepsilon}_\\text{random} \\]\n\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is random; note that above we are assuming that \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\)\n\n\\(X\\) is random; again we make the assumption that our data are random samples from a distribution (also it’s noted as a capital letter!)\n\\(\\beta\\) is fixed! It is the set of parameters that defines the particular distribution in our statistical model that actually relates \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\n\\(Y\\) is also random; again by assumption, but also because \\(Y\\) equals some function involving random variables\n\nNote that if we instead consider \\(Y \\mid X = x\\), then\n\\[ \\underbrace{Y \\mid X=x}_\\text{random} = \\underbrace{x^\\top}_\\text{fixed} \\underbrace{\\beta}_\\text{fixed} + \\underbrace{\\varepsilon}_\\text{random} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Models\nThis linear regression model is just one statistical model we could use to describe our data. Almost any family of conditional distributions can be used instead. For example:\n\nThe more general linear regression model: we could consider the slightly more general case of conditional distributions defined by an expected value condition: \\[\\left\\{ P \\: : \\: \\mathbb E[Y \\mid X = x] \\: = \\: x^\\top\\beta, \\:\\: \\beta \\in \\mathbb R^p \\right.\\}\\]\n\nNote that \\(\\mathbb E[\\mathcal{N}(x^\\top\\beta, \\sigma^2)] = x^\\top \\beta\\), and so the linear regression model is a subset of this more general model.\nHowever, this model allows for the possibility of non-normal residuals.\n\nThe polynomial regression model: we could instead consider the slightly more general case where the expectation is a polynomial function of \\(X\\), rather than just a linear function: \\[\\left\\{ P \\: : \\: \\mathbb E[Y \\mid X = x] \\: = \\: p(x), \\:\\: p \\text{ is a polynomial of degree } d \\right\\}\\]\n\nNote again that our general linear model is a special case; however this model allows for more complex relationships between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nThis model also has parameters (the coefficients of the polynomial), though they are not explicit in this formulation.\n\nAll possible distributions: what if we used the most general set of distributions? \\[\\left\\{ P \\: : \\: P(Y \\mid X = x) \\text{ is any distribution} \\right\\}\\]\n\nWhile this is a valid set, it turns out that it is too general for the purposes of learning.\nSpecifically, the no free lunch theorem states that we will not be able to identify a “good” model from this set even if we were given infinite training data!\n(We need to have some “structure” or simplifying assumptions in our model to be able to learn from data.)"

    "section": "Estimation",
    "text": "Estimation\nWe’ve talked about making predictions from a distribution selected by our statistical model. But how did we choose that distribution? (Or alternatively, how did we choose \\(\\hat\\beta\\)?)\n\nThe estimation step involves us choosing a specific distribution from the model (or alternatively, the parameters \\(\\hat \\beta\\) defining the distribution) that best fits our training data.\nThere are many statistically valid estimation procedures. We’ll derive two that you’ve likely seen before: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). (We’ll talk about others throughout this course.)\n\nWe will work through these two procedures using the linear regression model as our statistical model.\n\n1. Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)\nGoal: Find the parameters that minimize the loss on our training data.\n\nFrom STAT 306, you may remember a procedure known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model.\nThis procedure is a special case of a more general procedure Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for reasons that we will see in a few lectures.\n\nThe OLS/ERM Procedure:\nThe goal of ERM is to choose the distribution (i.e. set of parameters) that minimizes the loss over predictions on our training data.\n\nGiven a set of parameters \\(\\hat \\beta\\), let \\(\\hat Y_i\\) be the predictions that we make on the training data using the prediction rule derived from the loss \\(L(Y, \\hat Y)\\).\nThe empirical risk is defined as the total loss over our training data:\n\\[\\hat{R}(\\hat \\beta) =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n L(Y_i, \\hat Y_i)\\]\nwhere we (typically) use the same loss that governs our prediction rule. Using the squared loss, \\(\\hat{R}(\\hat\\beta) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top \\hat\\beta)^2\\)\nThe ERM estimator is the set of parameters \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) (i.e. the distribution from our model) that minimizes this empirical risk:\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_\\mathrm{OLS} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\hat{R}(\\beta) = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2\\]\nTaking the derivative and setting to zero:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2 = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i(Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta) = 0\\]\nBy arranging all of our training data into a matrix \\(\\boldsymbol X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}\\) and a vector \\(\\boldsymbol Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\), with\n\\[\\boldsymbol X = \\begin{bmatrix} -X_1^\\top- \\\\ -X_2^\\top- \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ -X_n^\\top- \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}, \\qquad \\boldsymbol Y = \\begin{bmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{bmatrix},\\]\nwe get:\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_\\mathrm{OLS} = (\\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol X)^{-1} \\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol Y.\\]\n\n\n\n2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\nGoal: Find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing our data.\n\nThe likelihood function maps a distribution from our model (parameterized by \\(\\beta\\)) to the probability density of our observed training data.\n\nLikelihood function for linear regression.\n\nFor the linear regression model with normal errors, the likelihood function is: \\[\\mathcal{L} (\\beta, \\sigma^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\]\nThe term inside the product is the density of the normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(X_i^\\top\\beta, \\sigma^2)\\) evaluated at \\(Y_i\\).\nWe take the product over all \\(n\\) training examples \\((X_i, Y_i)\\) because we assume that the data points are i.i.d.\nWe choose \\(\\hat\\beta\\) to maximize the likelihood function, i.e. the \\(\\hat\\beta\\) that make observed data most probable.\n\nLog-likelihoods are easier to work with.\n\nTaking the log of the likelihood function, log-likelihood: \\[\\ell(\\beta, \\sigma^2) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2\\]\nThe logarithm is a monotonic function, so maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood.\nThe maximizer of this log likelihood function (and thus the maximum of the likelihood function) is thus equal to: \\[\\mathrm{argmax}_{\\beta} -\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2 = \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\\top\\beta)^2,\\]\n\n\nDetails:\n\nThe \\(-\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\\) constant and the \\(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\) scaling term also don’t affect the maximum, so we can ignore them.\n\nThis is exactly the same optimization problem we derived for ERM! Thus, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_\\mathrm{MLE} = (\\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol X)^{-1} \\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol Y = \\hat{\\beta}_\\mathrm{OLS} \\]\n\nKey Insight: For linear regression with normal errors, MLE and OLS/ERM give identical results!\n\nIf we had used a different loss function (e.g. \\(L(Y_i, \\hat{Y_i}) = |Y_i - \\hat{Y_i}|\\)), the ERM estimator would not be the same as the OLS/MLE estimator.\nThere are many possible loss functions with different properties, and we will explore them in future lectures."

Which one should we use?\nTest error is out. There’s nothing special about the particular test set we happened to withhold. We’d much rather know the average error over all possible points, so expected test error is strictly better.\nRegarding expected test error vs. risk, there’s some debate. In general I would argue that risk is actually the metric we care most about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExpected Test Error vs. Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons to prefer expected test error\n\nIn practice, we only have one training set \\(\\mathcal D\\).\nExpected test error tells us how well our model will perform on the particular training set we are given.\n\nReasons to prefer risk\n\nIn practice, we might get new data to retrain our model on; we don’t want a metric that’s dependent on a particular training set.\nIf we’re trying to select a “best” model, we’d ideally like one that’s not too sensitive to the particular training set we happened to get.\nAs we will see next lecture, risk is easier to analyze theoretically.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 75% of scenarios, it doesn’t matter if we target risk or expected test error. (In practice, most estimators of risk are also estimators of expected test error, and vice versa.) However, we’ll see some cases (e.g. on Homework 2) where the distinction matters."

Running OLS on this dataset will result in zero training error, but the risk of this model will be much higher than zero on new data!\n\n\n(Training error does indeed have its uses; we’ll see one example next lecture!)\n\n\n\nIdeal Solution: Many Samples of Training Data + One Test Point\n\nImagine we had access to a generator that produces random \\(\\left\\{ (X_i, Y_i) \\right\\}_{i=1}^{n+1}\\) samples, where the \\(n+1\\) pairs are i.i.d.\nWe could estimate risk by:\n\nGenerating \\(m\\) samples \\(\\left\\{ \\left\\{ (X_i^{(j)}, Y_i^{(j)} \\right\\}_{i=1}^{n+1} \\right\\}_{j=1}^{m}\\)\nEstimate risk as: \\[ \\hat{\\mathcal R} \\approx \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m L_j,\n  \\quad L_j = L\\left( Y_{n+1}^{(j)}, f_{\\mathcal D^{(j)}}( X^{(j)}_{n+1}) \\right),\n  \\quad \\mathcal D^{(j)} = \\left\\{ (X_i^{(j)}, Y_i^{(j)}) \\right\\}_{i=1}^n.\n  \\]\n\n\nIn other words, for each of the \\(m\\) samples, we train a model on the first \\(n\\) data points, and compute its loss on the \\(n+1^\\mathrm{th}\\) datapoint we withhold from training.\n\nBy the law of large numbers, as \\(m \\to \\infty\\) we have:\n\\[\\hat{\\mathcal R} \\to \\mathbb E[ L( Y_{n+1}, \\hat f_\\mathcal{D}( X_{n+1}) )] = \\mathcal R\\]\n\n\n\nPractical Solution: Cross-Validation\n\nIn practice, we only have access to a single dataset \\(\\mathcal D = \\left\\{ (X_i, Y_i) \\right\\}_{i=1}^n\\) with \\(n\\) data points.\nNevertheless: we can approximate the ideal solution above using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCross Validation\n\n\n\n\nGiven: a single dataset \\(\\mathcal D = \\left\\{ (X_i, Y_i) \\right\\}_{i=1}^n\\)\nFor each \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\):\n\nTrain a model \\(\\hat f_{\\mathcal D_{-i}}\\) on the dataset with the \\(i^\\mathrm{th}\\) point removed: \\(\\mathcal D_{-i} := \\left\\{ (X_j, Y_j) \\right\\}_{j \\neq i}\\)\nCompute the loss on the withheld point: \\(L_i := L(Y_i, \\hat f_{\\mathcal D_{-i}}(X_i))\\)\nEstimate risk as: \\(\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{LOOCV} := \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n L_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Does LOO-CV Work?\n\nEach \\(L_i\\) is an unbiased estimate of risk on a training set of size \\(n-1\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\mathbb E[L_i] &= \\mathbb E \\left[ L(Y_i, \\hat f_{\\mathcal D_{-i}}(X_i)) \\right] =: \\mathcal R_{n-1} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBy linearity of expectation, we also have that \\(\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{LOOCV}\\) is an unbiased estimate of risk on a training set of size \\(n-1\\):\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathbb E[\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{LOOCV}] = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n L_i \\right]\n    = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb E[L_i] = \\mathcal R_{n-1}\n  \\end{align*}\\]\n\nUnlike our “ideal estimator” above, the \\(L_i\\) are not independent, and therefore we can’t apply the law of large numbers to conclude that \\(\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{LOOCV}\\) converges to \\(\\mathcal R\\).\nIn practice, however, \\(\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{LOOCV}\\) is often a good estimator of risk.\n\n\n\nA More Efficient Solution: K-Fold Cross Validation\n\nLOO-CV requires training \\(n\\) separate models, which can be very expensive.\nA more efficient alternative is K-fold cross validation (K-CV):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipK-Fold Cross Validation\n\n\n\n\nGiven: a single dataset \\(\\mathcal D = \\left\\{ (X_i, Y_i) \\right\\}_{i=1}^n\\)\nRandomly split \\(\\mathcal D\\) into \\(K\\) (roughly) equal-sized “folds”: \\(\\mathcal D_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal D_K\\)\nFor each \\(k = 1, \\ldots, K\\):\n\nTrain a model \\(\\hat f_{\\mathcal D_{-k}}\\) on the dataset with the \\(k^\\mathrm{th}\\) fold removed: \\(\\mathcal D_{-k} := \\bigcup_{j \\neq k} \\mathcal D_j\\)\nCompute the loss on the withheld fold: \\(L_k := \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal D_k|} \\sum_{(X_i, Y_i) \\in \\mathcal D_k} L(Y_i, \\hat f_{\\mathcal D_{-k}}(X_i))\\)\nEstimate risk as: \\(\\hat{\\mathcal R}_\\mathrm{K-CV} := \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=1}^K L_k\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreasing \\(K\\) decreases the number of models we need to train.\nHowever, decreasing \\(K\\) also results in a worse estimator of risk.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nIntuitively: as \\(K\\) decreases, each model is trained on less data, and we’re trying to estimate the risk of a model trained on all \\(n\\) data points.\nFormally: each \\(L_k\\) is an unbiased estimate of risk on a training set of size \\(n - n/K\\), but the difference between \\(\\mathcal R_n\\) and \\(\\mathcal R_{n - n/K}\\) can be significant for small \\(K\\)."

    "text": "Summary\n\nWe have now introduced our first method to help us navigate the bias-variance tradeoff: ridge regression, which introduces bias to reduce variance.\nThe Problem: OLS has high variance when \\(\\boldsymbol X\\) is ill-conditioned (multicollinearity), which occurs when some singular values are near zero, making \\((\\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\\) unstable.\nThe Solution: Ridge regression constrains coefficients via \\(\\|\\beta\\|_2^2 \\leq s\\) (or equivalently adds penalty \\(\\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_2^2\\)), which shrinks coefficients toward zero and stabilizes the solution with closed form \\(\\hat{\\beta}_\\lambda = (\\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol X + \\lambda \\boldsymbol I)^{-1} \\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol Y\\).\nThe Tradeoff: Ridge introduces bias but significantly reduces variance, and we can use cross-validation to find the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) that minimizes prediction risk in the bias-variance tradeoff."
