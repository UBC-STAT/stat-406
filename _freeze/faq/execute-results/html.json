Ensure you are on the `main` branch. Pull in remote changes by clicking the down arrow <i class=\"fas fa-arrow-down\" style=\"color:blue\"></i>.\n2. Create a new branch by clicking the branch icon <i class=\"fas fa-code-branch\" style=\"color:purple\"></i>.\n3. Work on your documents and save frequently.\n4. Stage your changes by checking the appropriate boxes.\n5. Commit your changes by clicking **Commit**.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 as needed.\n7. Push to GitHub by clicking the up arrow <i class=\"fas fa-arrow-up\" style=\"color:green\"></i>.\n8. Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub.\n9. Use the dropdown menu to return to `main` to avoid potential issues.\n\n### Command Line Git Workflow\n\nIf you prefer using the command line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Pull remote changes (optional but recommended): `git pull`\n2. Create a new branch: `git branch -b <name-of-branch>`\n3. Work on your documents and save frequently.\n4. Stage your changes:\n   - For specific documents: `git add <name-of-document1>`\n   - For all changed documents: `git add .`\n5. Commit your changes with a meaningful message: `git commit -m \"Descriptive commit message\"`\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 as needed.\n7. Push to GitHub: `git push` (follow any suggested command variations)\n8. Open a pull request on GitHub.\n9. Switch back to `main`: `git checkout main`\n\n## Homework Regrade Procedure\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Regrade Eligibility\n\n1. Deductions must exceed 3 points and be related to content (not penalties).\n2. Errors can be corrected to potentially raise the grade to 7/10.\n3. Revisions and review requests must be submitted within one week of the initial review.\n:::\n\nRegrade process:\n\n1. Locate the local branch for the specific homework assignment.\n   - Check the \"Pull Requests\" tab in your GitHub repository if you can't recall the branch name.\n2. Make necessary corrections to the files.\n3. Commit and push changes, ensuring the PDF is re-rendered if needed.\n4. Find the original PR for the assignment on GitHub.\n5. Add a concise, clear comment to the TA describing your changes.\n6. Click the recycling (üîÅ) button under \"Reviewers\" to request a review.\n\n## Common Git and Workflow Issues\n\n### `master/main`\n\n\"master\" has some pretty painful connotations. So as part of an effort to remove racist names from code, the default branch is now \"main\" on new versions of GitHub. But old versions (like the UBC version) still have \"master\". Below, I'll use \"main\", but if you see \"master\" on what you're doing, that's the one to use.\n\n\n### Start from main\n\nBranches should be created from the `main` branch, not the one you used for the last assignment.\n```bash\ngit checkout main\n```\nThis switches to `main`. Then pull and start the new assignment following the workflow above. (In Rstudio, use the dropdown menu.)\n\n### You forgot to work on a new branch\n\nUgh, you did some labs before realizing you forgot to create a new branch. Don't stress. There are some things below to try. But if you're confused ASK. We've had practice with this, and soon you will too!\n\n_(1) If you started from `main` and haven't made any commits (but you SAVED!!):_\n```bash\ngit branch -b <new-branch-name>\n```\nThis keeps everything you have and puts you on a new branch. No problem. Commit and proceed as usual.\n\n_(2) If you are on `main` and made some commits:_\n```bash\ngit branch <new-branch-name>\ngit log\n```\nThe first line makes a new branch with all the stuff you've done. Then we look at the log. Locate the most recent commit before you started working. It's a long string like\n`ac2a8365ce0fa220c11e658c98212020fa2ba7d1`. Then,\n```bash\ngit reset ac2a8 --hard\n```\nThis rolls `main` back to that commit. You don't need the whole string, just the first few characters. Finally\n```bash\ngit checkout <new-branch-name>\n```\nand continue working.\n\n_(3) If you started work on `<some-old-branch>` for work you already submitted:_\nThis one is harder, and I would suggest getting in touch with the TAs. Here's the procedure.\n```bash\ngit commit -am \"uhoh, I need to be on a different branch\"\ngit branch <new-branch-name>\n```\nCommit your work with a dumb message, then create a new branch. It's got all your stuff.\n```bash\ngit log\n```\nLocate the most recent commit before you started working. It's a long string like `ac2a8365ce0fa220c11e658c98212020fa2ba7d1`. Then,\n```bash\ngit rebase --onto main ac2a8 <new-branch-name>\ngit checkout <new-branch-name>\n```\nThis makes the new branch look like `main` but without the differences from `main` that are on `ac2a8` and WITH all the work you did after `ac2a8`. It's pretty cool. And should work. Finally, we switch to our new branch.\n\n\n## Improving Your R Programming Skills\n\n### Learning Approach\n\nLearning to code is an active, immersive process.\nSimply reading books or watching videos is insufficient.\nTo truly learn R:\n\n- Complete tutorials multiple times\n- Explore textbook code thoroughly\n- Question the rationale behind function choices\n- Experiment with different coding approaches\n- Break down and understand each line of code\n\n### Recommended Learning Resources\n\n- [Data Science: A First Introduction](https://datasciencebook.ca)\n- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)\n- [DSCI 310 Course Notes](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/README.html)\n- [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com)\n- [Modern Dive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com)\n- [Stat545](https://stat545.com)\n\n\n\n## Debugging Code\n\n### General Debugging Workflow\n\nWhen your code doesn't run:\n\n0. If the code runs but doesn't produce expected results, see the [code quality section](#writing-high-quality-code).\n\n1. **Read the Error Message**\n\n   - Error messages provide crucial debugging hints\n   - Parsing them can be challenging but is a valuable skill\n\n   Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n   ::: {.cell}\n   \n   ```{.r .cell-code}\n   set.seed(12345)\n   y <- rnorm(10)\n   x <- matrix(rnorm(20), 2)\n   linmod <- lm(y ~ x)\n   ## Error in model.frame.default(formula = y ~ x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE): variable lengths differ (found for 'x')\n   ```\n   :::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Notice the error about variable lengths and matrix dimensions.\n\n2. **Consult Documentation**\n\n   - Use function-specific help (e.g., `?matrix`)\n\n3. **Search Online**\n\n   - Copy error messages into search engines\n   - Remove specific, identifying information\n\n4. **Seek Peer Help**\n\n   - Use class Slack channels\n   - Prepare a minimal working example (MWE)\n\n5. **Instructor/TA Consultation**\n\n   - Be prepared to show your code\n   - Provide a reproducible example\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nWhen seeking help, always be ready to share your code or MWE.\n:::\n\nNote: If the error cannot be reproduced, it is unlikely that anyone can help you effectively.\n\n## Crafting Minimal Working Examples (MWEs)\n\nAn MWE is a compact code snippet that:\n\n- Reproduces an error on any machine\n- Isolates the specific problem\n- Minimizes external dependencies\n\nBenefits of creating MWEs:\n\n- Often helps you solve the problem independently\n- Reveals the root cause of issues\n- Makes it easier for others to help you\n\n### MWE Tips\n\n- Set random seeds for reproducibility\n- Use minimal, generic data\n- Include only essential code\n\nPreparing an MWE is a valuable debugging skill. By stripping your problem down to its bare essence, you often uncover the root issue. For instance, the previous debugging example was an MWE: it used a fixed seed, ensured data reproducibility, and focused on a specific error.\n\nFor further guidance, consult:\n\n- [R Overview Slides](schedule/lectures/00-r-review.qmd)\n- [Stack Exchange Discussion on MWEs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example-aka-mcve-minimal-complete-and-ver/5963610#5963610)\n\n## Writing High-Quality Code\n\nThis is covered in much greater detail in the lectures. Here are key principles for writing clean, efficient R code:\n\n1. **Use Script Files**\n\n   - Save and source scripts\n   - Avoid console-only work\n   - Treat R as a scripting language, not a calculator\n\n2. **Avoid Code Repetition**\n\n   - Never copy and paste code\n   - Define constants at the script's beginning\n   - Create reusable functions\n\n3. **Function Design**\n\n   - Functions are easily testable\n   - Verify inputs and outputs\n   - Catch potential errors through comprehensive testing\n\n4. **Error Types**\n\n   - Syntax errors (detectable by R)\n     * Missing parentheses\n     * Incorrect arguments\n   - Logical errors (require thorough testing)\n     * Require manual verification of results\n\n5. **Avoid Magic Numbers**\n\n   - Always define constants\n   - Make numerical values meaningful and clear\n\n6. **Use Meaningful Names**\n\n   Bad example:\n   ```r\n   data(\"ChickWeight\")\n   out <- lm(weight ~ Time + Chick + Diet, data = ChickWeight)\n   ```\n\n   Good example:\n   ```r\n   data(\"ChickWeight\")\n   chick_weight_model <- lm(weight ~ Time + Chick + Diet, data = ChickWeight)\n   ```\n\n7. **Comment Strategically**\n\n   - Explain code that isn't immediately clear\n   - Focus on the \"why\", not just the \"what\"\n\n   Example of helpful commenting:\n   ```r\n   # Calculate weighted average of chick weights, squared and adjusted\n   chick_weight_summary <- with(\n     ChickWeight,\n     by(weight, Chick, function(x) (x^2 + 23) / length(x))\n   )\n   ```\n\nRemember: Clear, readable code is as much about communication as it is about functionality.\n",
