McDonald\n\n-   [daniel\\@stat.ubc.ca](mailto:daniel@stat.ubc.ca){.email}\n\n-   <http://dajmcdon.github.io/>\n\n-   Associate Professor, Department of Statistics\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](https://dajmcdon.github.io/assets/img/big-bio-photo.jpeg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Philosophy of the class\n\nI and the TAs are here to [help you learn]{.secondary}. Ask questions.\n\nWe encourage [engagement]{.secondary}, [curiosity]{.secondary} and [generosity]{.secondary}\n\nWe favour [steady work]{.secondary} through the Term (vs. sleeping until finals)\n\n. . .\n\nThe assessments attempt to reflect this ethos.\n\n## More philosophy\n\nWhen the term ends, I want\n\n-   You to be better at coding.\n-   You to have an understanding of the variety of methods available to do prediction and data analysis.\n-   You to articulate their strengths and weaknesses.\n-   You to be able to choose between different methods using **your intuition** and **the data**.\n\n. . .\n\nI do not want\n\n-   You to be under undo stress\n-   You to feel the need to cheat, plagiarize, or drop the course\n-   You to feel treated unfairly.\n\n## \n\nI promise\n\n-   To grade/mark fairly. Good faith effort will be rewarded\n-   To be flexible. This semester (like the last 4) is different for everyone.\n-   To understand and adapt to issues.\n\n. . .\n\n[I do not promise that you will all get the grade you want.]{.secondary}\n\n# COVID considerations\n\n## On COVID\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   I work on COVID a lot.\n\n-   Statistics is hugely important.\n\n### Policies (TL; DR)\n\n-   I encourage you to wear a mask\n\n-   Do [NOT]{.secondary} come to class if you are possibly sick\n\n-   Be kind and considerate to others\n\n-   The Marking scheme is flexible enough to allow some missed classes\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](gfx/delphi.jpg) \n![](gfx/bccovid.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n# Course map\n\n##  {background-image=\"gfx/ml-black-box.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n::: notes\n-   We'll talk about lots of ML models\n-   But our focus is on how to \"understand\" everything in this diagram.\n-   How do we interpret? Evaluate? Choose a model?\n-   What are the implications / assumptions implied by our choices?\n-   Deep understanding of statistics helps with intuition.\n:::\n\n##  {background-image=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xca5fHw3L.jpg\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n##  {background-image=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jfPTGbRkL.jpg\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n##  {background-image=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916Fx6LagOL.jpg\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Predictive models\n\n<br><br>\n\n### 1.

Unsupervised learning\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Each module is approximately 2 weeks long\n\n-   Each module is based on a collection of readings and lectures\n\n-   Each module (except the review) has a homework assignment\n:::\n:::\n\n## Assessments\n\n[Effort-based]{.fourth-colour}\n\nTotal across three components: 65 points, any way you want\n\n1.

Only if you get lose 3+ for content (penalties can't be redeemed).\n\n* Don't leave these for the last minute\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[Labs]{.secondary}\n\n* Labs should give you practice, allow for questions with the TAs.\n\n* They are due at 2300 on the day of your lab, lightly graded.\n\n* You may do them at home, but you must submit individually (in lab, you may share submission)\n\n* Labs are lightly graded\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Clickers\n\n-   Questions are similar to the Final\n\n-   0 points for skipping, 2 points for trying, 4 points for correct\n\n    -   Average of 3 = 10 points (the max)\n    -   Average of 2 = 5 points\n    -   Average of 1 = 0 points\n    - `total = max(0, min(5 * points / N - 5, 10))`\n\n-   Be sure to sync your device in Canvas.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Don't do this!\n\nAverage \\< 1 drops your Final Mark 1 letter grade.\n\nA- becomes B-, C+ becomes D.\n:::\n\n## Final Exam\n\n-   Scheduled by the university.\n\n-   It is hard\n\n-   The median last year was 50% $\\Rightarrow$ A-\n\n[Philosophy:]{.secondary}\n\n> If you put in the effort, you're guaranteed a C+.  \n> But to get an A+, you should really deeply understand the material.\n\nNo penalty for skipping the final.\n\nIf you're cool with C+ and hate tests, then that's fine.\n\n\n## Advice\n\n-   Skipping HW makes it difficult to get to 65\n\n-   Come to class!\n\n-   Yes it's at 8am. I hate it too.\n\n-   To compensate, I will record the class and post to Canvas.\n\n-   In terms of last year's class, attendance in lecture and active engagement (asking questions, coming to office hours, etc.) is the best predictor of success.\n\n. . .\n\n### [Questions?]{.secondary}\n\n## Textbooks\n\n::: callout-important\n## An Introduction to Statistical Learning\n\nJames, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, 2013, Springer, New York.

It's 8am, everyone's tired.\n\n-   Coding is hard. I hope you'll get better at it.\n\n-   I strongly urge you to get up at the same time everyday. My plan is to go to the gym on MWF. It's really hard to sleep in until 10 on MWF and make class at 8 on T/Th.\n\n. . .\n\n<hr>\n\nLet's be kind and understanding to each other.\n\nI have to give you a grade, but I want that grade to reflect your learning and effort, not other junk.\n\n. . .\n\n<hr>\n\n[If you need help, please ask.]{.secondary}\n\n# Questions?\n\n<https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406/>\n\n<https://github.com/stat-406-2023/>\n",
