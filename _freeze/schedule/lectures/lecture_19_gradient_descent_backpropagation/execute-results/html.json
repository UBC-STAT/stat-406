However, these ideas generalize to deeper networks.)\n\n- As with many other predictive models we've studied, we fit the neural network parameters using empirical risk minimization.\n- Given some training data $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ and some loss function $\\ell(Y, \\hat Y)$, the neural network training problem can be written as:\n\n  $$\n  \\hat \\Theta, \\hat \\beta = \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\Theta, \\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell\\left(y_i, \\hat f_\\mathcal{D}(x_i; \\Theta, \\beta)\\right)\n  $$\n\n  where $f_\\mathcal{D}(x; \\Theta, \\beta)$ is the neural network's prediction for input $x$ given parameters $\\Theta$ and $\\beta$.\n  (We will often omit the dependence on $\\Theta$ and $\\beta$ for brevity.)\n- Unlike other models we've studied (e.g., linear regression, ridge regression),\n  there is no closed-form solution for this optimization problem,\n  and so we must resort to iterative optimization algorithms.\n\n**Fitting neural networks with iterative optimization algorithms:**\n\n- Before we discuss how to fit neural networks specifically,\n  we will first introduce a general-purpose optimization algorithm called *gradient descent*\n  which can be used to numerically optimize any differentiable function.\n- We will then discuss how to apply gradient descent to fit neural networks,\n  using an automated implementation of the chain rule called *backpropagation* to compute the necessary gradients.\n\n## The Gradient Descent Algorithm\n\n- Gradient descent is an *iterative optimization algorithm* for finding the minimum of a differentiable function $f(w): \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n  $$ w^* = \\mathrm{argmin}_w f(w) $$\n\n- It does not yield a closed-form solution, but instead produces a sequence of approximations that converge to the true function minimum.\n- The basic idea of the algorithm is simple:\n  we start with an initial guess of the minimizer $w_0 \\approx \\mathrm{argmin}_w f(w)$,\n  and then repeatedly update our guess using information from the gradient of $f$ at the current guess:\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"The Gradient Descent Algorithm\"}\n\nGiven:\n\n- A differentiable function $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to minimize\n- An initial guess $w_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\n- A step size (learning rate) $\\gamma > 0$\n\nRepeat for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ until convergence:\n\n$$ w_{n+1} = w_n - \\gamma \\nabla f(w_n) $$\n\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $w_n \\to w^* = \\mathrm{argmin}_w f(w)$ (under suitable conditions on $f$ and $\\gamma$).\n:::\n\n### 1D Example\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture_19_gradient_descent_backpropagation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- Here we are minimizing the function $f(w) = (w - 6)^2$ using gradient descent.\n(This function has a minimum at $w = 6$. We could solve it analytically, but this is just for illustration.)\n- Our initial guess is $w_0 = 23$ and we use a step size of $\\gamma = 0.1$.\n- The next step is in the direction of the negative gradient at $w_0$,\n  and it is relatively far away from $w_0$ because $\\nabla f(w_0)$ is large in magnitude.\n- After many iterations, the gradients become small, the updates change $w$ less,\n  and we converge to the minimum at $w = 6$.\n\n### Intuition\n\nThe gradient is a good heuristic to guide our search for the minimum of $f(w)$.\nIt contains information in both its direction and its magnitude.\n\n**What the direction tells us:**\n\n- The direction of our gradient $\\nabla f(w)$ tells us the direction of steepest ascent.\n- If we update $w$ in the negative gradient direction $-\\nabla f(w)$, we are moving $w$ in the most efficient direction to reduce $f(w)$.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture_19_gradient_descent_backpropagation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**What the magnitude tells us:**\n\n- If $\\Vert \\nabla f(w) \\Vert$ is large, then $f(w)$ changes rapidly near $w$.\n  It is unlikely that our current guess $w$ is close to the minimum,\n  and so we should move a larger distance to reach a better guess.\n- If $\\Vert \\nabla f(w) \\Vert \\approx 0$, then we are near a stationary point of $f$\n  (likely a minimum).\n  We should take smaller steps to avoid overshooting the minimum.\n\n### The step size $\\gamma$\n\n- The step size $\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter that controls how far we move in the negative gradient direction at each iteration.\n- A smaller $\\gamma$ means smaller steps, which can lead to more stable convergence but may take longer to reach the minimum.\n- A larger $\\gamma$ means larger steps, which can speed up convergence but risks overshooting the minimum.\n\n  :::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Why would larger steps risk overshooting the minimum?\"}\n  - Imagine that we are very close to the minimum of $f(w)$, and $\\Vert \\nabla f(w) \\Vert = 0.1$.\n  - If we use $\\gamma = 1000$, then our update would move $w$ by $1000 \\times 0.1 = 100$ units, which is likely to take us far away from the minimum.\n  :::\n\n- In general, it is useful to **decay** the step size throughout the course of gradient descent, as we get closer to the minimum.\n\n  :::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Why should we decay the step size?\"}\n  - Early in the optimization, we want to take larger steps to make rapid progress toward the minimum.\n  - As we get closer to the minimum, we want to take smaller steps to fine-tune our solution and avoid overshooting.\n  :::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture_19_gradient_descent_backpropagation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=1440}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- There are many strategies for choosing the appropriate step size/decay rate.\n  - For neural networks, it is common to treat these as hyperparameters and tune them using validation data.\n  - There are also many adaptive step size algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp) that adjust the step size automatically during training.\n\n\n### Mathematical Justification: Taylor Expansions\n\n- A more rigorous justification of gradient descent comes from the Taylor expansion of $f(w)$ around $w_0$.\n\n- Our goal is to approximate $f(w)$ with a function that we can minimize in closed form.\n\n- Consider the first-order Taylor expansion of $f(w)$ around $w_0$:\n\n  $$\n  f(w) \\approx f(w_0) + \\nabla f(w_0)^\\top (w - w_0)\n  $$\n\n- This linear approximation is only good for $w$ close to $w_0$, i.e. when\n\n  $$ \\|w - w_0\\| < \\alpha \\quad \\text{for some } \\alpha. $$\n\n- We can thus update our guess $w$ by minimizing this linear approximation within the region where it is \"good\":\n\n  $$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  w_1 &= \\mathrm{argmin}_{w} \\left[ f(w_0) + \\nabla f(w_0)^\\top (w - w_0) \\right] \\\\\n      &= \\text{(subject to } \\|w - w_0\\| < \\alpha \\text{)}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  $$\n\n- As with ridge regression, this constrained optimization can be written in a Lagrangian form:\n\n  $$\n  \\mathrm{argmin}_{w} f(w_0) + \\nabla f(w_0)^\\top (w - w_0) + \\lambda \\|w - w_0\\|^2\n  $$\n\n  where $\\lambda > 0$ is some constant that depends on the constraint $\\alpha$.\n\n- This optimization problem has a closed-form solution:\n\n  $$\n  w_1 = w_0 - \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\nabla f(w_0)\n  $$\n\n  which is our gradient descent update with step size $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda}$!\n\n\n\n### Stopping Criteria\n\nFor some small tolerance $\\epsilon > 0$ (e.g., $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$), we can check any/all of the following conditions:\n\n1. **Gradient magnitude**: $\\|\\nabla f(w^{(k)})\\| < \\epsilon$\n   - Stop when the gradient is nearly zero (i.e., we are close to a stationary point).\n\n2. **Step size**: $\\|w^{(k)} - w^{(k-1)}\\| < \\epsilon$\n   - Stop when successive iterates are very close to each other.\n\n3. **Function value change**: $|f(w^{(k)}) - f(w^{(k-1)})| < \\epsilon$\n   - Stop when the function value stops changing significantly.\n\nThese criteria may or may not indicate that we have reached the global minimum (especially if we are optimizing a non-convex function), but it is a sign that we have nearly reached a local minimum or stationary point.\n\n\n## Gradient Descent for Neural Networks\n\nNow we can apply gradient descent to fit neural networks!\n\n- Recall that we want to minimize the empirical risk:\n\n  $$\n  \\hat \\Theta, \\hat \\beta = \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\Theta, \\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ell\\left(y_i, \\hat f_\\mathcal{D}(x_i; \\Theta, \\beta)\\right)\n  $$\n\n- Assuming we're using the squared error loss $\\ell(y, \\hat y) = (y - \\hat y)^2$ and a one-hidden-layer neural network, this optimization problem becomes:\n\n  $$\n  \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_m, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_m} \\mathcal L,\n  \\qquad \\mathcal L = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( Y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^m \\beta_j g(\\theta_j^\\top X_i) \\right)^2\n  $$\n\n- The gradient descent updates for the parameters are:\n\n  $$\n  \\theta_j^{(k+1)} = \\theta_j^{(k)} - \\gamma \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\bigg|_{\\theta_j = \\theta_j^{(k)}},\n  \\quad\n  \\beta_j^{(k+1)} = \\beta_j^{(k)} - \\gamma \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\beta_j} \\bigg|_{\\beta_j = \\beta_j^{(k)}}\n  $$\n\n  So we need to compute the gradients $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\theta_j}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\beta_j}$.\n\n- Returning to calculus, we can compute these gradients using the chain rule. Let's walk through the process in gory detail so that we can see the algorithmic pattern emerge.\n\n\n### Computing the Gradients via the Chain Rule\n\n- Let's recall our 1D diagram of a one-hidden-layer neural network with $m$ hidden units:\n\n![One-hidden-layer neural network diagram](../figures/nn_1layer.png){width=\"400px\"}\n\n- Let's write $\\mathcal L$ in terms of numerous intermediate variables to make the chain rule application clearer:\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Neural Network Forward Pass\"}\n- For $i = 1, \\ldots, n$\n  -

The second term is easy:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial \\Theta} = X_i^\\top\n    $$\n\n  - The first term is more complex, but we can always apply the chain rule again:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L_i}{\\partial P_i} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L_i}{\\partial A_i} \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial P_i}\n    $$\n\n  - Again, $\\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial P_i}$ is easy:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial P_i} = \\mathrm{diag}\\left( g'(P_{i1}), \\ldots, g'(P_{im}) \\right)\n    $$\n\n  - For the remaining term, we again recursively apply the chain rule:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L_i}{\\partial A_i} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L_i}{\\partial \\hat Y_i} \\frac{\\partial \\hat Y_i}{\\partial A_i}\n    $$\n\n  - We repeat this recursion until we reach the \"end\" of the computational graph,\n  when all terms are easy to compute.\n\n- If we implement this recursion in practice, we'll start by computing the gradients at the end of the computational graph (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L_i}{\\partial \\hat Y_i}$),\n  and then **propagate** these gradients backwards to compute earlier gradients via the chain rule.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Neural Network Backward Pass\"}\n- For $i = 1, \\ldots, n$\n  -

It could instead be a poor local minimum or saddle point.\n- The stationary point we converge to depends heavily on the initial parameter values supplied to gradient descent.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture_19_gradient_descent_backpropagation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n2. **Computation time**: Each iteration of gradient descent requires computing the empirical risk $\\mathcal L = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal L_i$,\nwhich in turn requires a forward and backward pass through the entire neural network for all $n$ training examples.\n\n- For large datasets and complex networks, this can be computationally expensive.\nIf we need thousands of iterations to converge, the total computation time can be prohibitive.\n:::\n\n### Solution: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n\n- A solution to both of these challenges is to use *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD).\n- Instead of computing the gradient of the empirical risk over the entire dataset at each iteration,\n  we compute the gradient using only a small random subset (mini-batch) of the data.\n\n  :::{.callout-note title=\"The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Algorithm\"}\n  For each iteration of gradient descent $k = 1, 2, \\ldots$:\n\n  1.
