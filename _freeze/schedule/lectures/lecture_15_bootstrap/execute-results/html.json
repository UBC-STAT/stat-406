Explain the bootstrap procedure and its purpose in estimating confidence intervals\n2. Identify when the bootstrap is more/less advantageous than analytic methods of uncertainty quantification\n2. Articulate the assumptions underpinning the bootstrap and its limits as an approximation\n3. Implement the bootstrap for any statistical algorithm in pseudocode\n4. Differentiate between different bootstrap intervals and identify the \"correct\" one\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe spent much of the first half of the course on linear models,\nin part due to their ubiquity but also due to our ability to analyze them statistically.\n\n- In STAT 306, you derived analytic **confidence intervals** for linear models as a way to quantify uncertainty in our parameter estimates/the true responses due to limited data.\n- In this course, we probably demonstrated that methods like **ridge regularization** reduce variance.\n- Moreover, we rigorously argued that methods like **basis expansions** reduce bias.\n\nHowever, these methods for uncertaity quantification, variance reduction, and bias reduction all relied on linear structure. Other predictive/statistical models do not have such convenient analytic properties.\n\nIn this module, we will replace **mathematical analysis** with **computational simulation** to achieve similar goals.\n\n1. In this lecture, we will introduce the **bootstrap**, a computational method for estimating predictive uncertainty in arbitrary predictive models (with almost no assumptions about the statistical or predictive model)!\n\n2. In the following lectures, we will introduce **ensemble methods** as generic tools to either provably reduce variance (**bagging, random forests**) or reduce bias (**boosting**).\n\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification\n\nIn STAT 306, you produced confidence intervals for the regression function $\\mathbb E[Y \\mid X=x]$ of a (fixed) test covariate $x$ under the assumptions of a linear statistical model:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(Stat406)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndata(prostate, package = \"ElemStatLearn\")\nprostate <- prostate |> filter(train == TRUE) |> select(-train)\nlm_fit <- lm(lpsa ~ . , data = prostate)\ntest_x <- data.frame(\n  lcavol = 0, lweight = 3, age = 65,\n  lbph = 0, svi = 0, lcp = 0, gleason = 7, pgg45 = 0\n)\npredict(lm_fit, newdata = test_x, interval = \"confidence\", level = 0.95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        fit       lwr      upr\n1 0.8296435 0.2661997 1.393087\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- These confidence intervals tell us that, under our linearity assumptions, the regression function evaluated at $x$ (i.e. $\\mathbb E[Y\\mid X=x]$ will fall within the interval with 95% probability.\n\n  :::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"What does \\\"95% Probability\\\" Mean?\"}\n  - We assume that our training data are **random samples** with $Y = X^\\top \\beta + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, for some fixed $\\beta, \\sigma$.\n  - 95% probability refers to the randomness in the training data.\n  - If we repeatedly sampled new training datasets, trained linear models on them, and computed 95% confidence intervals for predictions at $x$,\n  then 95% of those confidence intervals would contain $\\mathbb E[Y \\mid X=x]$.\n  :::\n\n- We derive these confidence intervals analytically using our statistical model, properties of our OLS estimator:\n\n  $$\n  \\begin{align}\n    \\mathbb E[ \\hat \\beta_\\mathrm{OLS}] &= \\beta \\\\\n    \\mathrm{Cov}[ \\hat \\beta_\\mathrm{OLS} \\mid \\boldsymbol X] &= \\sigma^2 (\\boldsymbol X^\\top \\boldsymbol X)^{-1},\n  \\end{align}\n  $$\n\n  and by using the fact that $\\hat \\beta_\\mathrm{OLS} \\mid \\boldsymbol X$ is Gaussian under our statistical model.\n\nHowever, consider what happens if we use a predictive model that's based on a more complicated (or implicit) statistical model, like a decision tree or k-nearest neighbors.\n\n- We haven't necessarily defined the conditional distribution of $Y \\mid X$.\n- Even if we did, the recursive decision tree algorithm is too complicated to compute expectations/variances of the estimator analytically.\n\n\n### Simulation-Based Statistics\n\nThe key idea in this lecture (and module) is to use **brute-force computation** when closed-form math becomes too difficult.\n\n- Imagine that we want to construct a confidence interval around the regression function $\\mathbb E[Y\\mid X=x]$ for some (fixed) test covariates $x$ based on our prediction $\\hat Y = \\hat f_{\\mathcal D}(x)$\n\n  - As always, $\\hat f_{\\mathcal D}$ is a predictive model trained on dataset $\\mathcal D$.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Why do we Care About Confidence Intervals for Predictions?\"}\n- Intuitively, these confidence interval should reflect how much $\\hat Y$ would change if we had a different training dataset $\\mathcal D'$.\n- If the confidence interval is narrow, then $95\\%$ of all training samples would lead to similar predictions at $x$,\ngiving us confidence that this prediction is likely accurate.\n- Conversely, if the confidence interval is wide, then we know that the prediction is highly sensitive to the training data,\nand we should be less confident in its accuracy.\n:::\n\n- In order to compute a confidence interval for $Y$ based on the central limit theorem,\n  we need to estimate $\\mathrm{Var}[ \\hat Y \\mid X=x ] = \\mathrm{Var}[ \\hat f_{\\mathcal D}(x) ]$\n\n- If we had access to $100$ different training samples,\n  we could train $100$ different models $\\hat f_{\\mathcal D^{(1)}}, \\ldots, \\hat f_{\\mathcal D^{(100)}}$,\n  compute their predictions at $x$, and estimate this variance empirically.\n\n- However, we only have access to one training dataset $\\mathcal D$.\n  We thus need a way to **simulate** different training datasets $\\mathcal D^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\mathcal D^{(100)}$ using only the data in $\\mathcal D$.\n\n- This idea of (1) simulating new datasets and (2) using those datasets to estimate uncertainty is the core idea behind **simulation-based statistics**.\nWe use computation to approximate mathematical expectations/variances that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n## Approximating New Datasets via the Bootstrap\n\n- Imagine that I have $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ drawn i.i.d. from some distribution $P(X)$.\n\n- The **empirical distribution** $\\hat P(X)$ is the discrete distribution that places mass $1/n$ at each observed data point $X_i$:\n\n  $$\n  \\hat P(X=x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{X_i}(x)\n  $$\n\n  where $\\delta_{X_i}(x)$ is a point mass at $X_i$.\n\n- If $n$ is large enough, then $\\hat P(X) \\approx P(X)$:\n\n\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n  set.seed(1)\n  n <- 100\n  x <- rnorm(n)\n  hist(x, probability = TRUE, breaks = 10, main = \"Empirical Distribution vs True Distribution\")\n  curve(dnorm(x), col = \"red\", add = TRUE, lwd = 2)\n  legend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"True Distribution\", \"Empirical Distribution\"), col = c(\"red\", \"black\"), lwd = 2)\n  ```\n  \n  ::: {.cell-output-display}\n  ![Empirical distribution approximating true distribution](lecture_15_bootstrap_files/figure-html/empirical-dist-example-1.png){width=480}\n  :::\n  :::\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"What is the Implication of $\\hat P(X) \\approx P(X)$?\"}\n- Let's imagine I sample a new point $X^*$ from $P(X)$, and another point $\\hat X^{*}$ from $\\hat P(X)$.\n- If $\\hat P(X) \\approx P(X)$, then the distribution of $X^*$ and $\\hat X^{*}$ should be similar.\n- Thus, sampling from the empirical distribution $\\hat P(X)$ is (approximately) equivalent to sampling from the true distribution $P(X)$!\n:::\n\n- If we wish to sample a whole-new dataset $\\mathcal D' = \\{ X_1', \\ldots, X_n' \\}$ that has (approximately) the same distribution as our original dataset $\\mathcal D = \\{ X_1, \\ldots, X_n \\}$,\nwe can thus sample each $X_i'$ i.i.d. from the empirical distribution $\\hat P(X)$.\n\n### The Bootstrap\n\nThis idea gives us a recipe to sample many datasets $\\mathcal D^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\mathcal D^{(B)}$ that are (approximately) drawn from the same distribution as our original dataset $\\mathcal D$, which is often referred to as **the bootstrap**:\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"The Bootstrap\"}\n  1. Construct the empirical distribution $\\hat P(X, Y)$ based on the observed data points $(X_i, Y_i)$ in $\\mathcal D$.\n  2.

(**Important**: this step will require training $b$ models on the $b$ simulated datasets if the statistic of interest is a model prediction.)\n  3. Compute the empirical variance $\\mathrm{Var}[ \\hat f_{\\mathcal D^{(b)}}(x) ]$, or construct a confidence interval from the $B$ computed statistics (using methods to be explained shortly).\n:::\n\n- Note that we sample *with replacement* from the empirical distribution because we want each data point in the new dataset to be an independent draw from $\\hat P(X, Y) \\approx P(X, Y)$.\n\n- Once we have sampled these new datasets, we can train models $\\hat f_{\\mathcal D^{(1)}}, \\ldots, \\hat f_{\\mathcal D^{(B)}}$ on each dataset and use the predictions at $x$ to estimate the variance of $\\hat Y = \\hat f_{\\mathcal D}(x)$.\n\n- Amazingly, this simple procedure can be used to estimate the variance of the predictions from any model, or just about any statistic that we could ever care about!\nWe don't need to derive complicated analytic expressions, nor do we even need to make any (significant) assumptions about the statistical model underlying our data!\n\n:::{.callout-warning title=\"The Catch\"}\n- The Fundamental Premise (TM) of the Bootstrap is that **a sufficiently large sample looks like the population**, so that *sampling from the sample looks like sampling from the population.*\n- If $\\mathcal D$ is too small or not representative of the true data distribution, then the bootstrap will not yield datasets that approximate the true data distribution well, resulting in poor confidence intervals.\n:::\n\n### Example\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"A (Non-Predictive) Example\"}\nWhile we motivated the bootstrap as a way to obtain confidence intervals\naround the regression function $\\mathbb E[Y\\mid X=x]$ in learning problems,\nit's really a general way to form confidence intervals around any statistical quantity.\n\nHere we will walk through a non-predictive example, since you will look at a predictive example for homework!\n:::\n\nImagine that we have $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ drawn i.i.d. from $\\mathrm{Exponential}(1/5)$ with pdf $f(x) = \\frac{1}{5}e^{-x/5}$.\n\n- Imagine I want to estimate a confidence interval for the sample mean $\\bar X$.\n\n- The CLT (if $n$ is sufficiently large) gives\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\bar X -

It *does* have the right coverage (asymptotically) in some specific cases.\n\n  :::{.callout-warning title=\"What does the Percentile Interval Measure?\"}\n  - Recall that the bootstrap gives us many samples of $\\hat Y$ from (approximate/Bootstrap) training samples.\n  - The percentile interval constructs an (approximate) $95\\%$ confidence interval of $\\hat Y$;\n  i.e., $95\\%$ of models trained on different training samples would (approximately) produce predictions within this interval.\n  - However, this is *not* the same as a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true response $Y \\mid X=x$!\n  - Thus, the percentile interval may not have the correct coverage for the true response!\n  :::\n\n  <details>\n    <summary>When is the Percentile Interval Valid?</summary>\n    If there exists a monotonic function $m: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ so that $m(\\hat Y)$ is Gaussian distributed, i.e. $m(\\hat Y) \\sim N(m(\\hat Y), c^2)$, then the percentile interval has asymptotically correct coverage.\n\n    For most complicated statistics (e.g. the predictions of a decision tree),\n    it's hard to know whether such a function $m$ exists.\n  </details>\n\n- If we want (asymptotically) correct confidence intervals around the **true regression function**, we should use the **pivotal interval**.\n\n\n### The Pivotal Interval\n\n- The **pivotal interval** is given by\n\n  $$\n  [2\\hat Y - \\hat Y^{(b)}_{1-\\alpha/2},\\ 2\\hat Y - \\hat Y^{(b)}_{\\alpha/2}]\n  $$\n\n  where again $\\hat Y$ is the statistic computed on the original dataset, and $\\hat Y^{(b)}_q$ is the $q$ quantile of the bootstrap sample statistics.\n\n- This interval is justified under fairly general conditions, and thus is the preferred method for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals of the true regression function $Y \\mid X=x$\n\n- *For details on why this interval works, see [All of Statistics, Ch. 8.3](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/), or visit me in office hours!*\n\n\n:::{.callout-warning title=\"What about Other Bootstrap Intervals?\"}\n- There are many other bootstrap confidence intervals (e.g. the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) interval),\nbut they are more complicated to compute and don't have significant advantages over the pivotal interval in most cases.\n- At the very least, you should **definitely NOT use** the \"normal\" confidence interval $[\\hat{Y} - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\hat{\\mathrm{se}}, \\:\\: \\hat{Y} + z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\hat{\\mathrm{se}}]$,\nwhich is only likely to work if $\\hat Y$ is approximately Gaussian.\n:::\n\n## Sources of Error, and Improving the Bootstrap\n\nThe bootstrap is, at the end of the day, just an approximation.\nThere are two sources of error that could make our variance estimates or confidence intervals incorrect:\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Sources of Error in the Bootstrap\"}\n1. **Statistical error** from using only $n$ data points to estimate the true data distribution. We don't have the whole population so we make an error by using a sample. (Note: this part is what __always__ happens with data, and what the science of statistics analyzes.)\n\n2. **Simulation error** from using only $B$ samples to estimate $\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat Y]$.\n:::\n\n\n### Correcting for Statistical Error\n\n- We can used more advanced methods to alleviate the statistical error from using only $n$ data points.\n- For example, the **parametric bootstrap** assumes some assumptions about the data-generating distribution (e.g. $\\hat Y$ is Gaussian) to improve the quality of the bootstrap samples.\n- However, if you make incorrect assumptions about the data distribution, you may make things worse!\n\n\n### Correcting for Simulation Error\n\n- This one's easier, at least in theory!\n- You can always use more Bootstrap samples $B$ to reduce simulation error.\n- In practice, start with $B=100$ or $B=1000$ samples and compute your variance/confidence intervals. Then try adding $100$ more samples. If your confidence intervals change significantly, keep adding more samples until they stabilize.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"More is Better\"}\n- \"Just add more samples\" will be a common refrain throughout this module.\n- In simulation-based statistics, or when using any computational black-box methods, accuracy will almost always improve if you throw more compute at the problem (i.e. more samples, more models, etc.)\n- In practice, you will have a limited amount of computing power, but we've essentially removed one design decision: use as much computing power as you have available to get the best results.\n:::\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- Simulation-based statistics uses computation to approximate mathematical expectations/variances that we cannot compute analytically.\n- The bootstrap is a general-purpose method for estimating variances/confidence intervals based on simulating new datasets from the empirical distribution of the observed data.\n- The bootstrap can be used to estimate uncertainty for almost any statistic, including predictions from arbitrary predictive models.\n- The bootstrap will only work if our empirical data distribution is large enough to approximate the true population.\n- The pivotal interval is the preferred method for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals for true responses.\n\nIn the homework, you'll apply the bootstrap to compute uncertainty estimates of machine learning models. In the next lecture, we'll show how this bootstrap principle can be applied to make predictions more accurate!\n",
