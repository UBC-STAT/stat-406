In order to participate in this class, we will require the use of R, and encourage
the use of RStudio. Both are free, and you likely already have both. If not, see below.
These instructions are taken from [UBC's MDS site](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/), thanks!

After installation, in Terminal type the following to ask for the version:
```
R --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:
