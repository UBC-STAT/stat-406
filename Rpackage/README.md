<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `UBCstat406labs` is to be a one-stop install for all the
packages, tutorials, and custom code used in UBCâ€™s Stat 406 course.

## Installation

You can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ubc-stat/stat-406/Rpackage", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you currently available labs:

``` r
library(UBCstat406labs)
show_labs()
#> Available tutorials:
