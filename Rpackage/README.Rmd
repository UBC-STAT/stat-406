<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `UBCstat406labs` is to be a one-stop install for all the packages, tutorials, and custom code used in UBC's Stat 406 course.

## Installation

You can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ubc-stat/stat-406/_Rpackage", dependencies = TRUE)
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you currently available labs:

```{r example, eval=TRUE}
library(UBCstat406labs)
show_labs()
```

To run a particular lab:


```{r all-tutorials, eval=FALSE}
run_lab("rsquared")
```
