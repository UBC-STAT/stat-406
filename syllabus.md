### Course objectives

This is a course in statistical learning methods. Based on the theory of
linear models covered in Stat 306, this course will focus on applying many
techniques of data analysis methods to interesting datasets. 

The course combines analysis with methodology and
computational aspects. It treats both the "art" of understanding
unfamiliar data and the "science" of analyzing that data in terms of 
statistical properties. The focus will be on practical aspects of methodology and intuition
to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and
approaches to problems in their own lives. 

#### Learning outcomes

1. assess the prediction properties of the supervised learning methods covered in class; 
2. correctly use regularization to improve predictions from linear models, and also to identify important explanatory variables; 
3. explain the practical
difference between predictions obtained with parametric and non-parametric methods, and decide in specific applications which approach should be used; 
4. select and construct appropriate ensembles to obtain improved predictions in different contexts; 
5. select sensible clustering methods and correctly interpret their output; 
6. correctly utilize and interpret principal components and other dimension reduction techniques;
7. employ reasonable coding practices and understand basic R syntax and function.




### Textbooks

**Required**:

*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*, James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, 2013, Springer, New York. (denoted \[ISLR\])

Available **free** online: <http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html>

    
*The Elements of Statistical Learning*, Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman, 2009, Second Edition, Springer, New York. (denoted \[ESL\])

Also available **free** online: <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/>

This second book is a more advanced treatment of a superset of the topics we will cover. If you want 
to learn more and understand the material more deeply, this is the book for you. With the exception of Chapter 10, all readings from \[ESL\] are optional.


### Course assesssment opportunities

1 Mini pre quiz (1%)  
5 In-class mini quizzes (1% each)  
5 In-class group quizzes (1% each)  
5 Peer evaluations (1% each)  
5 Midterm exams (14% each)  
1 Comprehensive final exam (14%)  
1 Discussion opportunity (+/- 1%)


**Alternative asynchronous syllabus**  
If for any reason, you wish to complete the course asynchronously, you may email my by midnight on 30 September to request to complete the course "asynchronously". The intention behind this option is to accomodate internet connectivity, family, work, life, or other issues which may arise. In this case, the grading scale will be modified. Note that all exams must still be taken during the scheduled time (1530h-1700h Vancouver local time) through Canvas. Changes requested after this date will be made at the discretion of the instructor.

1 Mini pre quiz (1%)  
5 In-class mini quizzes (2% each)    
5 Midterm exams (15% each)  
1 Comprehensive final exam (14%)  
1 Discussion opportunity (+/- 1%)


**Missed assessment policy**  
Missed or late peer evaluations result in the student receiving no credit. All other missed
opportunities will have their weight added to the comprehensive final exam. There are no other makeup opportunities. If you miss more than 2 midterm exams, you must request an academic concession through your academic advising office. 




### Group synchronous sessions

Synchronous class periods will be spent working on and discussing group coding exercises, similar to lab sessions. Each student will be assigned a group for the entirety of the semester. Your group assignment will be determined by your selected Lecture time (1600h or 2000h) as well as other factors. You must attend your selected Lecture time each session. If you cannot attend, missed quizzes will have their weight added to the comprehensive final exam. But students should be aware that their groups are counting on them. If you miss a session, your peers may give you lower peer evaluation scores.   





### Important considerations

#### Academic Concessions

These are handled according to UBC policy. Please see
* [UBC student services](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions)
* [UBC Vancouver Academic Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,0,0,0)
* [Faculty of Science Concessions](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/concession)

#### Missed final exam

Students who miss the final exam must report to their Faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your Faculty Advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their Faculty.
